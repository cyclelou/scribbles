<p><br />Sloth is a free and open-sourced app that&#39;s been around for twenty
years. It provides an app by app breakdown of all open files and sockets
in use by all running processes on your system. This makes it easy to
inspect which apps are using which files and sockets. In activity
monitor, you get information on processes, but not on what app they
belong to or where they are located on disk. Every so often, when you
are troubleshooting an obscure problem, you need that information. I
recently had to track down what app was causing my Mac to slow to a
crawl every time I encountered an open/save dialog box. Sloth was
helpful during that process.</p>

<p>You may end up surprised at some processes running on your box. Despite
everything I have tried, the inescapable Adobe virus insists on running
some process whenever my computer is on, despite having all their apps
set to not run at login.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>View all open files, directories, IP sockets, devices, Unix domain sockets and pipes</li>
<li>Filter by name, access mode, volume, type, location, or using regular expressions</li>
<li>Sort by name, process ID, user ID, process type, bundle identifier, etc.</li>
<li>View IP socket status, protocol and version</li>
<li>View sockets and pipes established between processes</li>
<li>Inspection window with detailed macOS and Unix file/socket/process info</li>
<li>Powerful contextual menu for file operations</li>
<li>In-app authentication to run with root privileges</li>
</ul>

<p>Sloth is <a href="https://sveinbjorn.org/sloth/">available on GitHub</a>
and can be downloaded via Homebrew. </p>

<pre>$ brew install --cask sloth</pre>
