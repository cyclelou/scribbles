<p><br />In blogging and in creating instructional documents at work, I go
through plenty of screenshots, stock photography and open-source images
from the web. In the course of crafting a single blog post, I might use
four or five apps.</p>

<p>For screenshots, I use <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/cleanshot-x">CleanShotX</a> which
I call from a keyboard shortcut or the menu bar. It also does
annotation. The files are saved to my default screenshot folder that
lives on a cloud drive so that I can readily access it from all my
computers and devices.</p>

<p>When the file is saved, it activates <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast">Clop</a>
which optimizes the file size automatically. The optimized file is
handed off to <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/dropover-best-in-class">Dropover</a>
and then an <a
href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/5fb38973fcb64f89be4185276f3c654a">Apple
Shortcut</a> (download link) runs that moves the file to another cloud
folder, called &quot;Optimized&quot; and which also opens a <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/dropover-best-in-class">Dropover</a>
shelf so that I can drag the file into place if my current working
situation calls for it. <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/dropover-best-in-class">Dropover</a>
also lets me rename the file, convert to another format and resize the
file. I can even open the file in <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/imageoptim-free-and-open-source-utility-to-reduce-file-sizes">ImageOptim</a>
right from the shelf if I want to reduce the file size to a greater
extent than <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast">Clop</a>
performed.</p>

<p>For images other than screenshots, they go straight to my downloads
folder, where they get optimized by <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast">Clop</a>
and then moved to the &quot;Optimized&quot; folder by a shortcut ready for use.</p>

<p>Since I go through numerous images, I don&#39;t want my &quot;Optimized&quot; folder
to get bloated, so I use <a
href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/10/my-favorite-actions.html">Hazel</a>
to move files that are more than one day old. It sorts the files in two
ways. Screenshots (which have a special string in the file name)are
moved to a &quot;Screenshots-Old&quot; folder. The rest of the image files, which
can be jpg, png, svg or webp get sorted by file extension and moved to
an archive folder. <a
href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/10/my-favorite-actions.html">Hazel</a>
does all this based on pre-configured rules, and it all happens
automatically.</p>

<p>For images other than screenshots, they go straight to my downloads
folder, where they get optimized by <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/clop-copy-big-paste-small-send-fast">Clop</a>
and then moved to the &quot;Optimized&quot; folder by a shortcut ready for use.</p>
