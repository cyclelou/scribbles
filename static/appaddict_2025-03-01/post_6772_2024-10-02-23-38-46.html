<p><br />Anyone looking for a well-designed notes app that&#39;s free and open
source, native to the Mac platform and based on plain text files would
be well served by checking out <a
href="https://notenik.app/">Notenik</a> by independent developer <a
href="https://hbowie.net/about.html">Herb Bowie.</a>. Within Notenik you
can create numerous types of collections of notes including but not
limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Notes</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>To-dos</li>
<li>Sequenced list</li>
<li>Zettlekasten</li>
<li>Blog</li>
<li>Commonplace Book (with or w/out lookups)</li>
<li>Outline</li>
<li>Web Book</li>
<li>Website</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Travel Planner</li>
<li>Code snippets</li>
</ul>

<p>Each collection of notes lives in a separate folder. The default
location for the notes is iCloud but you can store then anywhere you
want. You can save them as txt or Markdown files. Even though there
isn&#39;t a native iOS app, you can use iOS text editors like Taio, iAWriter
or 1Writer to access and edit your notes on that platform.</p>

<p>Each copy of Notenik comes with a complete knowledge base in Notenik
format to help you use the application. The knowledge base is updated
when new features are added and it is available offline.</p>

<p>Like other modern plain text notes apps, Notenik supports tags and other
metadata. You can use double bracket wikilinks to connect your notes.
For blind and visually impaired users, Notenik is fully voice over
compatible.</p>

<p>This is an app that you need to download and experiment with to fully
understand its power when it comes to things like creating websites and
databases and all the options you have to incorporate personal
productivity options into your note taking. The developer is very
responsive and publishes a constant stream of new and improved features
as well as squashing any bugs. Because Notenik is available <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notenik/id1465997984?mt=12">from the
App Store,</a> it is easy to keep it updated.</p>
