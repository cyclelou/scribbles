<p><br />Clotski is a 99 cent menu bar app available in <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-applications/id1630766571?mt=12">the
Mac App Store</a>. Its simple menu lets you designate watched folders
where you keep images accessed as part of your workflow, for instance
screenshots and downloads. You can view thumbnails of the images, the
size is customizable and get info on them which includes name, size,
dimensions, creation date, tag, caption and modification date. Tags and
captions can be added from with Clotski. The information presented can
be customized, and other metadata can be added if you wish. You can open
the image with your default app or choose from other compatible apps
from an &quot;open with&quot; menu. When viewing the list of images in a folder
you can choose a list, grid or gallery view, and you can choose the sort
order based on date or file size in ascending or descending order.</p>

<p>One feature that is especially helpful is Clotski&#39;s ability to
automatically download any images you copy to the clipboard into a
folder you designate. You can set your own naming convention, as well as
choosing to save them in either jpg or png formats.</p>

<p>For keyboard warriors, Clotski can be summoned with a custom shortcut,
and it can be navigated without the use of a mouse. For further
organization, Clotski lets you create collections of photos along with
tags and folders. Collections can be accessed from a drop-down menu
within the program If desired, you can designate an automatic tag to be
applied to images you add to newly collected images. You can use the
tags just with Clotski, or you can sync them with the Finder.</p>

<p>While working with images in Clotski, you can copy or drag them into
documents on which you are working. Clotski does not have any native
editing functionality,</p>
