<p>Sandkorn, from developer Peter Borgas, is a free app that provides you
comprehensive information on the apps installed on a computer,
particularly sandboxed apps and what those apps are entitled to access.</p>

<p>Every app you obtain from the Mac App Store today is sandboxed, isolated
from other apps and information sources, however, the apps have certain
entitlements to different resources on your computers, some of which,
but not all, you can see in <strong>System Settings &gt; Security and
Privacy.</strong> On a Mac, what you see in your applications folder are
actually bundles you can right-click on an app and select <strong>View
Package Contents</strong> and see what is contained in the bundle. Some
apps have plugins and XPC services bundled with them that have their own
entitlements. BBedit has 18. Xcode has a whopping 90!</p>

<p>Entitlements are things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Microphone</li>
<li>Printing</li>
<li>Incoming Network Traffic</li>
<li>Outgoing Network Traffic</li>
<li>Folders in your home directory</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I only have six apps showing in my Security and Privacy
Settings that have permission to access my camera, there are 56 apps
that are capable of using it. Theoretically, they should ask before I
access a feature that requires its use, but I&#39;m just a guy on my couch
with a laptop. If you are analyzing software in a highly sensitive area,
knowing these entitlements is vital information.</p>

<p>Aside from the information I have already described, Sandkorn is the
best app I&#39;ve found for generating lists based on certain criteria, like
architecture. If you&#39;re one of the people that recoil in horror over the
prospect of using Rosetta on your precious M-series Mac, Sandkorn can
tell you if you have any Intel apps installed. It can generate lists of
pure Apple Silicon and Universal apps. If you keep apps in a
non-standard location, such as an external or secondary hard drive, you
can have Sandkorn scan those locations too.</p>

<p>Get additional information on Sandkorn at <a
href="https://www.peterborgapps.com/sandkorn/">the developer&#39;s
website</a>. Check out his other apps like Lingon X and Smultron while
you&#39;re there.</p>

<p>You can download Sandkorn from the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sandkorn/id1377973524?mt=12&amp;ls=1">Mac
App Store.</a></p>
