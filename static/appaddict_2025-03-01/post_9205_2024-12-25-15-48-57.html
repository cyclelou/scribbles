<p>Glympse</p>

<p><a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glympse-share-your-location/id330316698">Glympse</a>
is a helpful iOS app that allows you to temporarily, safely and securely
share your location with anyone who can receive text messages,
regardless of platform. The message contains a URL to a map with an icon
representing the locale of the sender. Although there is a paid option
for organizations and commercial enterprises, the basic application is
free and sufficient for the typical user. </p>

<p>To use Glympse, you use your contacts or enter a phone number, or
multiple numbers. There is a space for a short message, e.g., &quot;On the
way&quot;.  You choose the length of time to share your location and
optionally, your destination. </p>

<p>You can save numbers and contacts in the Glympse app if you frequently
communicate with the same people. For instance, I have my mom and
daughter saved in the app since they both live a few hours away. If
contacts both have Glympse installed, they can use the app to request
that another user share their location. </p>

<p>Glympse also allows the creation of private groups. &quot;Glympse Private
Groups is a feature of the Glympse app that creates a private,
invite-only Glympse Group. Members of a Group can share their location
to and request the location (within the group) of other members. Any
member of the group can see the location of everyone that is actively
sharing within the group. They are perfect for sharing with family,
carpool, teams, or a group of friends. The Group is private and not
accessible by others, unless they are signed in to Glympse, and have
received an invite from an existing member.&quot;</p>

<p>Then there are public groups. &quot;Glympse Public Tags is a feature of the
Glympse app that allows you to quickly view and share your location with
multiple people on a single, shared Glympse map. Anyone who knows your
Glympse Public Tag name can view the tag map and add themselves to the
map. When you view a tag map, what you are seeing is a map of people who
have chosen to join the Glympse Public Tag map.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used Glympse for years. I find it simple and easy to use for even
technically challenged folks. </p>
