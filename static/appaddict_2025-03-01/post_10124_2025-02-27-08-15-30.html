<p><br />Many people have become concerned that changes in the US politics,
the FCC and attitudes in the big American tech companies may result in
less reliable privacy protections in the software they use. One solution
is to move to using apps and services provided by European and Canadian
companies. Australian writer <a
href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/">Joan Westernberg</a> did a deep
dive on her tech stack recently, and here are a few apps she
recommended, some of which I have featured previously on AppAddict.</p>

<h2><em>ToDoist - Europe</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://todoist.com/">ToDoist</a> is a privacy first task and
calendar app available for macOS and iOS available <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-calendar/id585829637?mt=12">on
the App Store.</a> Todoist is a simple yet powerful planner tool that
organizes both your life and work. It can also be used a habit tracker.
Subscription based.</p>

<h2><br /></h2>

<h2><em>iAWriter - Switzerland</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iAwriter</a> a markdown/plain text
editor designed especially for writing and document creation. It isn&#39;t a
text editor in the fashion of VS Code or BBEdit. If you aren&#39;t a
markdown wiz, all the commands are accessible from the menu bar. The
simplified interface is its hallmark, but it has various powerful tools
behind the curtains. Your documents are local by default, with options
to use end-to-end encrypted storage solutions. <a

<h2><em>Proton - Switzerland</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://proton.me">The Proton Foundation </a>offers a list of
encrypted services including email, cloud storage, a password manager, a
calendar, and a VPN. None of its products are subject to US surveillance
laws. It markets itself on its privacy features and isn&#39;t likely to
follow the VC funded pattern of using your data to maximize profit.</p>

<h2><em>Joplin - France</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://joplinapp.org">Joplin</a> is an open-source notes app
that offers a local only option or syncing on servers based in France.
You can also opt for syncing on your choice of end-to-end encrypted
services. It offers importing from various formats including Evernote,
Markdown and plain text. It has a powerful web clipper and a plugin
architecture, making it an extensible choice with support for multiple
platforms.</p>

<h2><em>Vivaldi - Norway and Iceland</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://appaddict.app/post/a-day-with-vivaldi-browser">Vivaldi
is my browser choice</a> for its built-in privacy and tracking
protections and its extreme customization options. It has powerful
security, power consumptions, appearance and tab management features as
well as a built-in calendar, email and feed reader. There is a companion
app for iOS.</p>

<h2><em>LibreOffice - Germany</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> is a
full-featured open-source office suite used by millions. It features a
word processor, spreadsheets, presentations in an open format but can
also open and save in Microsoft Office formats. Microsoft products are
infamous for being telemetry filled and AI influenced. This is a solid
privacy protecting alternative.</p>

<h2><em>Cozy Cloud - France</em></h2>

<p><a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a> is a personal cloud to
gather all your data like bills, notes, and passwords. It&#39;s GDPR,
privacy-focused, open source, and hosted in France. It has a limited
free plan for you to investigate.</p>
