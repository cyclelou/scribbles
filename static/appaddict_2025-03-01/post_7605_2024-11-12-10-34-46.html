<p><a href="https://snapsrch.sparklide.com/">Snapsrch</a> is a utility that
lets you conduct searches on selected text in a convenient popup. Out of
the box, it is preconfigured to search Google, Bing, Wiktionary, Google
Translate and Wikipedia. Adding other search options is a breeze. I
included AllMusic, YouTube, Amazon, Max, DuckDuckGo and Reddit in just a
few minutes. I have not included any AI searches in my setup, but they
are just as easy to set up.</p>

<p>Using it is as easy as selecting the text and opening Snapsrch with a
hotkey. If you don&#39;t have any text selected, and you invoke the hotkey,
you can type a query into the popup. You can choose the window size you
want for the popup, by selecting user elements for iPhone, iPad, Mac or
custom. You can also choose to invoke Snapsrch with a mouse or trackpad
gesture. If you are a Popclip user, there is an extension available to
add Snapsrch. This allows you to consolidate any search terms you are
using into one icon, decluttering the Popclip interface.</p>

<p>Other Snapsrch options allow you to hide custom elements of any search
page you create and to have them load to a specific location on the
page. Snapsrch has OCR capabilities in several languages, so you can
even search for text in images and videos. There is a built-in history
of your searches you can toggle on or off. It is helpful when you need
to refer back to a previous search.</p>

<p>Snapsrch is available <a>on the Mac App Store</a> for $5.99. You can use
the trial version as much as you want. You just get a popup asking you
to purchase it every 50 uses.</p>
