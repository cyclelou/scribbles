<p>When I started working in EdTech, instructors were still using
transparency based overhead projectors. When interactive white boards
arrived, incorporating connected computers for use instead of grease
pencils and plastic, it felt like the future, but the high cost of the
easily damaged devices coupled with the need for projectors using
replaceable bulbs eventually left schools looking for a better
alternative, which in most cases is a cheap, large screen television
connected via HDMI. Additionally, since 2020, remote meeting software
like Zoom, Google Meet and Teams is now used daily in the business
world. Presenters who use either of these methodologies need an
affordable and dependable tool to assist them with annotation and
highlighting. <a href="https://presentifyapp.com/">Presentify by Ram
Patra</a> fits the bill.</p>

<p>Featured by Apple on three separate occasions, this app with its menu
bar interface offers various shapes, colors and gradients, as well as
text entry for anything on your display. Even with an app running in
full-screen mode, you can toggle Presentify whenever you wish to add an
element. If you wish, you can set any element to auto-erase. If you have
an iPad connected via Sidecar, Astropad or Duet Display, you can use
that as well as Wacom and other drawing tablets. Presentify has a
whiteboard mode that you can use independently of other apps. Control of
Presentify is achieved through and onscreen palette or keyboard
controls.</p>

<p>The other primary feature of Presentify is mouse cursor highlighting,
allowing you to change the color, size and opacity of the cursor, which
can be used when it is moving or still.</p>

<p>Presentify is a one-time $6.99 purchase in the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/presentify-screen-annotation/id1507246666?mt=12">Mac
App Store</a>, with an IAP option to tip the developer. It is also
available through Setapp. It&#39;s a well reviewed app that was received
positively on <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22938604">Hacker News</a> and
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/presentify">Product Hunt</a>.</p>
