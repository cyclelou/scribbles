<p><br />If you like finding out about interesting and useful software, I&#39;m
making it easier for you to get detailed updates about what is
available.</p>

<p>I started posting reviews of Mac and iOS apps in April 2024. To date,
I&#39;ve reviewed over 300 apps, posted several roundups of free Mac
software and offered advice on Mac automation. So far, I&#39;ve been able to
respond to every message from readers with personalized advice when
asked. </p>

<p>I decided to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/appaddict">start a Kofi page</a>
is to enable me to provide reviews to people who would like to receive
them in newsletter form. I&#39;ve had several requests and this appears to
be an easy to manage method of getting the news about the latest apps to
anyone who wants it in their inbox</p>

<p>Each of my reviews contains a link to where you can download the
software, as well as its cost - if there is one. I am not affiliated
with any developer or commercial publisher. I&#39;ve been downloading,
testing and using Mac software since the days of the classic OS. Most of
my reviews are recommendations, but I occasionally post a &quot;stay away&quot;
warning if I find something egregious that I think folks should avoid.</p>

<p>If you are a developer and would like me to review your app, contact me
through the blog. I don&#39;t review every app I&#39;m presented with, but if
you&#39;ve made something unique and helpful, I&#39;ll be glad to take a look
and give you some feedback.</p>
