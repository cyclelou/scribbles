<p><br />Protecting your online privacy is an ongoing game of whack-a-mole
with big tech. Google is making a big deal out of eliminating tracking
cookies at the same time is <a
href="https://tuta.com/blog/digital-fingerprinting-worse-than-cookies">implementing
tracking based on digital fingerprinting</a> for which few protections
exist. One organization working on privacy protection solutions for this
invasive technology is the Electronic Freedom Foundation (EFF). It&#39;s
free privacy tool is a browser extension, <a
href="https://privacybadger.org/\#What-is-Privacy-Badger">Privacy
Badger</a>, available for Chromium and Firefox browsers. A Safari
version is under development. Since tracker blocking is an ongoing
struggle, it&#39;s good to know that the developers at the EFF are actively
working on meeting the challenges of emerging invasive practices by big
tech.</p>

<p>Privacy Badger is not a traditional ad blocker, and it will not replace
whatever you are currently using. The extension is focused on preventing
companies big and small from tracking where you go on the Internet and
what you do there. It doesn&#39;t work off a list of URLs. Instead, it uses
an algorithm to determine if you are being tracked and takes action to
block offending sites. For tracking sites that you want to have a
relationship with, such as <a
href="https://louplummer.lol/how-to-internet-2025/">Meta</a> or X, it
provides clickable links to connect to them from external sites when you
choose to. I like that it creates an opt-in situation for you.</p>

<p>Privacy badger is compatible with native tracking prevention found in
more secure browsers like <a
href="https://appaddict.app/post/librewolf-for-security-and-privacy">Librewolf</a>,
Firefox and <a
href="https://appaddict.app/post/vivaldi-my-favorite-browser-just-got-some-updates">Vivaldi</a>.
As the political situation evolves in the US, protecting your browsing
habits will become more important than ever. Take the steps needed to
keep yourself safe from big tech and the government.</p>
