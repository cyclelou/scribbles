<p><br />One of the most popular features in <a
href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a>, the extensible keyboard
launcher, has been its floating notes feature. Using a quick keyboard
shortcut, users have been able to summon a window into which they could
type or paste information. Hiding the note and bringing it back was
easy, but there wasn&#39;t a lot more to it than that. With the recent
release of Raycast notes in version 1.8.5, floating notes have been
replaced with a new feature.</p>

<p>Raycast notes now support markdown. If you know the syntax, great. If
not, the notes window has a toolbar where you can select bold, italic,
bullets and so on. It also has &quot;inline code and code blocks, lists that
you can indent and reorder, checklists, links and more.&quot;</p>

<p>Raycast users without the pro plan can have up to five notes, while pro
members get an unlimited number. There are built-in commands for New
Notes and Search Notes. If you use the commands frequently, then, like
any other command in Raycast, you can assign a hot key to them.</p>

<p>The action pane (⌘+K)l for the Raycast notes command has several
choices:</p>

<ul>
<li>New note</li>
<li>Browser notes</li>
<li>Copy note deep link</li>
<li>Create Quick link</li>
<li>Format</li>
<li>Disable window auto-resizing</li>
<li>Export (HTML, Markdown, Plain text)</li>
<li>Recently deleted notes</li>
<li>Delete</li>
</ul>

<p>Quick links allow you to open a note with a single keystroke. The notes
window may be moved anywhere on the screen. It will stay on top until
dismissed.</p>
