<p>One of my favorite utilities, one I&#39;ve used through several version is
<a href="https://aptonic.com/">Dropzone 4 from Aptonic</a>. It is a
menubar app that performs a variety of functions. Similar to apps like
<a href="https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/mac/">Yoink</a>, <a
href="https://unclutterapp.com/">Unclutter</a> and <a
href="https://dropoverapp.com/">Dropover</a>, it provides a space to
park files you need to copy elsewhere later. You can also create a grid
of folders where you frequently copy files to have them always available
even if Finder isn&#39;t open. One of my favorite features is shortcut
integration. I use <a
href="https://heydingus.net/shortcuts/microblog-multimedia-uploader">a
shortcut by Jarrod Blundy over at HeyDingus!</a> to upload images to my
blog host (<a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>). I get prompted
to provide alt-text and after doing so I get a Markdown link
conveniently copied to my clipboard. Other features include:</p>

<p>• Shorten URLs quickly using TinyURL shortener. Just select a URL to
shorten and press Ctrl+Option+Cmd+S and the shortened URL is
automatically copied to the clipboard.<br />• AirDrop integration lets
you drop files or folders from any app and share them with your other
Macs over the network.<br />• Imgur integration lets you share images
fast and get a link for pasting.<br />• Quickly resize and convert
images between different sizes and formats.<br />• Upload files to
Amazon S3 <br />• Upload files to your FTP server<br />• Upload files to
your Google Drive<br />• Download and install add-on actions that let
you upload to services like Google Drive, YouTube and many others.<br
/>• Powerful multi-tasking engine allows you to run multiple tasks at
once and track the progress of each one through the in-grid task status
area.<br />• See how tasks are progressing at a glance in the animated
menu item.<br />• Launch Dropzone actions with the newly added keyboard
shortcuts feature<br />• Add applications, folders or actions to your
grid easily by dragging and dropping them on the Add to Grid area.<br
/>• Develop your own actions using the updated and massively improved
Ruby or Python API</p>

<p>When downloaded from the <a href="https://aptonic.com/">Aptonic
website</a> the app is $35 for a lifetime license. The same license is
$39 if you get it from the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropzone-4/id1485052491?mt=12">App
Store</a>. If you don&#39;t want to spend that much or just try it out, you
can pay $1.99 per month. If you are a <a
href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4">SetApp</a> subscriber, you
are in luck as Dropzone Pro is included in your subscription.</p>
