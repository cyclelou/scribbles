<p><br />I need to write to external NTFS formatted drives from my M3 iMac
on a regular basis for my job. I investigated the free options,
primarily <a href="https://mounty.app/">Mounty</a> and found them to
have a little too much friction for me on a computer running Sonoma with
the aforementioned Apple Silicon. I opted for paid software for this
mundane task. My choice was <a
href="https://iboysoft.com/ntfs-for-mac/">iBoysoft NTFS Mounter for
Mac</a> and in the four months since I installed it, I haven&#39;t had a
single read/write error.</p>

<p>NTFS Mounter works in the finder and in alternative file managers like
Path Finder and Qspace. It adds the ability to format drives with NTFS
using Disk Utility. It installs as a startup item and lives in the
menubar of your computer. I never need to access its settings, since the
defaults work perfectly well, so I used Bartender to hide the icon. It
works with SSD drives connected via USB-C and with various thumb drives
I access through a USB 3.0 hub. The speed is slower than natively
formatted drives, but it is bearable.</p>

<p>The one thing is cannot do that I wish it would - access NTFS drives
encrypted with Bitlocker. I still have to use a PC when that need
arises, which is seldom.</p>

<p>There is a free trial of 14 days. When that&#39;s over you can purchase it
for $49.95 or opt for a yearly subscription for $19.95. You can get it
<a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfs-read-write-iboysoft-ntfs/id1541571038?mt=12">on
the Mac App Store</a> as well as <a
href="https://iboysoft.com/ntfs-for-mac/">the developer&#39;s site.</a> 
It&#39;s also available through Setapp which is how I found it.</p>
