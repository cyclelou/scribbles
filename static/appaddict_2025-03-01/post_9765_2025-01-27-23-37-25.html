      <p><br />If you have online meetings using apps like Slack, Microsoft
Teams. Zoom or Google Meet, you can get free noise cancellation via AI
as well as meeting transcripts and recordings via <a
href="https://krisp.ai/">Krisp</a>, a business app with a generous free
tier. Make sure you clearly understand the privacy policy before doing
so.</p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation</h2>

<p>The AI-powered noise cancellation is bidirectional. It removes any
extraneous sounds, background voices and echos. If you elect to use only
this feature, none of the data from your calls is recorded on Krisp&#39;s
cloud servers. Users of the free plan get 60 minutes of cumulative noise
cancellation per day. If you purchase a pro ($8 a month)or a business
($15 a month) plan, you get unlimited voice cancellation.</p>

<h2>Recording and Transcription</h2>

<p>If you choose to let Krisp record your calls onto its cloud servers, you
can get unlimited diarized transcription for free and the paid plans
also offer audio and video recordings of your meetings. Krisp technology
can generate meeting notes complete with action items. The data is
presented to you in a way that makes it easy to share with other meeting
participants.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

<p>Krisp encourages people signing up for an account to use their work
email by granting a seven-day free trial of the pro plan to those who
do. As part of the sign up procedure I had to give it access to either
my Outlook calendar or Google calendar. My organization doesn&#39;t allow
third-party apps to access anything inside our Microsoft 365 tenant, so
I opted to connect a Google account. It asked for access to all my
contacts, which I did not grant. It asked for access to my calendar
events, which I did grant. Furthermore, it asked for access to all
calendars to which I have access. I said no to that. After that, my
account was created, and I was provided an opportunity to download the
software, which comes as a package installer.</p>

<h2>Reading the Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Krisp says that the recordings of your meetings are encrypted and stored
on its cloud servers, and that it does not use the content for any
business purposes. However, it does collect considerable data about your
specific computer, tying the machine identifier to your account
identity. It makes that data available to third-party vendors and if you
want to know what happens then, you have to find out who those vendors
are and what their individual privacy policies are. Krisp also</p>

<p>This site uses Google, Twitter, LinkedIn &amp; Facebook remarketing
services or tags to advertise to previous visitors to Krisp on
third-party platforms such as those mentioned. With the help of cookies
or tags, these remarketing services allow it to advertise itself to
visitors who may have visited them. Thankfully, they provide opt-out
links to every one of the services right from the privacy policy page.</p>

<p>The other thing that jumped out at me about their privacy policy was
their clear admission that if the cops come for your data, Krisp is
going to give it to them.</p>

<p>I can see a use for the app for areas of my life that aren&#39;t sensitive
and that I can wall off from my primary Internet presence. Work related
calls don&#39;t give me privacy heartburn and volunteer activities that
don&#39;t involve any kind of political engagement are OK too, if I feel
like going to the trouble of making a separate Google or Microsoft
account for them. Otherwise, I&#39;ll find some other solution.</p>
