<p><a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>, the RSS app and
service provider, got some new features today with the release of a new
browser extension for Chrome, Firefox and Edge.</p>

<ul>
<li>Save and organize content: Collect web pages and social media posts and tag them as you send them to Read later.</li>
<li>Annotate while you browse: Mark and annotate texts directly in your browser, then revisit your notes anytime in Inoreader.</li>
<li>Stay on top of your feeds: Monitor account activity, feeds, tags, and Team channels -- all without switching tabs.</li>
<li>Streamline article sharing: Share content to Team channels or set up rules for automated content distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h2><em>Existing Features</em></h2>

<p><strong><em>Custom Monitoring Feeds</em></strong></p>

<p>My favorite feature, hands down, are the <strong>custom monitoring
feeds</strong> Inoreader allows me to create. It scours the web every
hour to search for articles using my keywords. I have monitoring feeds
to help me track my favorite software titles for news and tips/tricks.
The wizard that creates these feeds lets me decide whether I want to
search entire articles or just titles. I can search the entire Internet
or just sources from sites whose main RSS feed I follow. As with all
feeds on Inoreader, I can set up a highlighter for my search terms
(Obsidian, Raycast, Keyboard Maestro, Micro.blog). I can filter out
terms I definitely do not find interesting (Android, Apple Vision Pro,
Trump). Finally, I can filter out duplicates and near duplicates so my
feed doesn&#39;t get inundated on dates when one of my keywords makes the
news, for example when updates to a certain title get released. It is
possible to place all these keyword monitoring feeds into a folder and
to view the output combined. I can even generate an OPML file with the
output to share with others!</p>

<p><strong><em>Newsletter Subscription Replacement</em></strong></p>

<p>Inoreader allows me to generate email addresses to use in
<strong>subscribing to newsletters</strong>. That way, I get the benefit
of their content without having my mailbox clogged up. Like every other
feed, these newsletters can be saved to OneDrive, Dropbox or Google
Drive. I can export them to Pocket or ReadWise, Instapaper, Blogger,
Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon or a custom location.</p>

<p><strong><em>Automation</em></strong></p>

<p>If you highlight text in any RSS article or newsletter, you can use the
highlight to <strong>trigger an IFTTT applet</strong>. You can do the
same with any article you mark to read later. In fact, IFTTT has a dozen
different triggers for Inoreader and over 2000 services you can connect
it to. You can read your feeds in a web browser or in your choice of RSS
readers like Reeder or NetNewsWire. I like their web interface so much
that on a desktop, I choose to use a stand-alone web app of their site
to read my feeds since it has easy access to most of the extra features
offered. On my iPhone and iPad, I use their app as opposed to a separate
RSS reader. Their iOS and Android apps have an offline mode allowing you
to download content to read later, useful for flights and helping you
avoid a separate subscription to a read it late service.</p>

<p><strong><em>Organization and Backup</em></strong></p>

<p>You can use folders or tags (or both) to organize your feeds. You can
set up notifications for different keywords or material from certain
sources. In the settings section of the Inoreader you can look at the
health of all of your feeds and easily determine if one is down,
allowing you to contact the blogger or publisher of the site in
question. If you currently have an RSS provider or reader, Inoreader can
easily import your feeds and conversely, it can export feeds for you if
you want to use them elsewhere. Your feeds get backed up every day, and
you can set them to be saved to a cloud folder synced with your computer
so you can have ready access to them. I use Dropbox for this.</p>

<p><strong><em>Other Features</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Built in podcast player</li>
<li>Turn Google News searches into feeds</li>
<li>Customize the look with your own CSS if desired</li>
<li>Get accelerated updates on certain feeds</li>
<li>Annotate and save articles</li>
<li>Multi-lingual content</li>
<li>Sync your YouTube subscriptions</li>
<li>Filtered Reddit feeds (see Obsidian posts without having to look at pictures of other people's graphs)</li>
</ul>

<p>Pricing for all the features I mentioned is $7.50 a month, paid
annually. You can download Inoreader for iOS and iPadOS <a

the App Store.</a></p>
