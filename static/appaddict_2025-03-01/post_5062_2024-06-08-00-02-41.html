<p>EtreCheckPro is an app that displays important system configuration
details and allows users to copy that information for analyzation and
use elsewhere. It helps identify and address system issues by generating
detailed reports after analyzing the system&#39;s performance. It is often
requested by experts among Apple Support Communities to help diagnose
issues for people requesting help. EtreCheck automatically removes any
personally identifiable information from the output.</p>

<p>EtreCheck will automatically alert you to serious problems like adware,
insufficient RAM, or a failing hard drive.</p>

<p>Using the program is simple. At startup, it asks you to choose a problem
from a list or you can choose &quot;just checking&quot;. Then you click the start
button and wait a few minutes while the program runs a scan. When it&#39;s
complete, information is provided in the following categories.</p>

<p><strong>Major Issues</strong> - Anything requiring immediate
attention<br /><strong>Minor Issues</strong> - Anything that could
potentially negatively affect performance<br /><strong>Hardware
</strong>- Includes computer, RAM, processor, battery (includes cycle
count and percentage available) and video<br /><strong>System</strong> -
Informations on your most recent notifications from apps with
notifications enabled, virtual memory, diagnostics performed in the last
60 days with links to the logs containing the reports <br
/><strong>Storage</strong> - Information on every partition describing
what it is used for, an option to scan your HD for a usage report,
Details on your Time Machine backups to include snapshots on your local
HD<br /><strong>Network</strong> - Detailed info on every network
interface, information on enabled sharing services, a section on  Top
Processes Snapshot by Network Use listing the top five<br
/><strong>Security</strong> - Lists status of built in tools like
Gatekeeper, notes if you are running AV software, lists all enabled
proxies and sharing services. Gives detailed info on all unsigned files
to include unsigned launchd files, unsigned running apps, unsigned login
items and total unsigned apps installed.<br /><strong>Software</strong>
- Information on System Extensions, Kernel Extensions,  System Launch
Daemons, System Launch Agents, Launch Daemons, Launch Agents, User
Launch Agents, User Login Items, Applications<br
/><strong>Performance</strong> - Detailed reports on CPU usage, memory
us and energy use<br /><strong>Report</strong> - a plain text report
that can be emailed or posted in a tech support forum</p>

<p>The program to run the report is free.</p>

<p>There is an in-app purchase ($17.99 for up to six machines) to upgrade
the program for people who want the following features: <br />1. See
computer-generated Solutions - for people who don’t want to post
anything on the internet<br />2. View detailed results and supporting
information about hardware, operating system, storage, networking,
software, and performance<br />3. Dive deep into analytics<br />4.
Compare your computer and your report to others</p>

<p><a href="https://etrecheck.com/en/welcome.html">The program is available
here. </a></p>

<p>(Note: There is an anonymous and poorly written document floating around
the Internet purporting that EtreCheckPro is malware. The EtreCheckPro
developer says the article was written by a long-time stalker of his
engaged in serial harassment. I believe him but use your own judgment.)</p>
