<p>A couple of weeks ago I saw <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1eu5s9d/is_there_an_app_to_manage_apps_something_that/">a
post on r/MacApps</a> for a utility that purported to back up your
preferences for a large number of apps, including perennial favorites
Keyboard Maestro, Hazel, Bartender, Text Expander and others. The name
of the utility is Mackup and it is <a
href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">available on GitHub</a>. Like I
often do when discovering new apps on this sub, I downloaded and
installed it. I proceeded to follow the instructions to backup my
system. And then, I was so hosed. The preferences for many of the apps
it &quot;backed up&quot; were not only set back to default, they were also set to
read only so that I could not redo them. Every time I reconfigured an
app and restarted it, nothing was saved and all the changes I just made
were gone. In order to get around the problem I had to use App Cleaner
to uninstall each app and then reinstall and reconfigure it.</p>

<p>I complained bitterly about this on social media, as one does, only to
find out that other app curious folks had the same experience. Finally
someone sent me a link to documentation from GitHub of other users
raising hell over the issue.</p>

<blockquote>This app should be removed from GitHub, or at least its destruction of all app and OS preferences should be clearly indicated as a warning to future users atop the readme.</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>Um, maybe that should be communicated via the app itself!?!?! I just lost all my configs after doing a backup - I even ran with the dry-run option first to make sure it was going to add what I expected. Rebooted this morning, all preferences are gone and iCloud does not keep backups. Yeah, this is an egregious abuse of user trust.</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<blockquote>Yes, mackup does not work correctly in Macos Sonoma, since it doesn't support symlinked files for preferences as it previously. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/1924">\#1924</a> and especially <a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup/issues/1924\#issuecomment-2115757100">this comment</a>.</blockquote>

<p><br />To be clear, I accept responsibility for my own actions. I have a
robust multi-backup system in place. I&#39;m also an experienced user with
intimate knowledge of my important apps and I was able to get everything
back to normal in short order, but for anyone without backups or less
experienced this could have been a real disaster. I thought I&#39;d warn
folks.</p>
