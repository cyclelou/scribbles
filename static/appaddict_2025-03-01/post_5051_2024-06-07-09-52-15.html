<p>There is no shortage of shelf apps for the Mac. With popular apps like
<a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yoink-better-drag-and-drop/id457622435?mt=12">Yoink</a>,
<a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unclutter/id577085396?mt=12">Unclutter</a>
and <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropzone-4/id1485052491?mt=12">Dropzone</a>
in the mix, <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dropover-easier-drag-drop/id1355679052?mt=12">Dropover
Pro, a $5.99 app in the App Store</a> still manages to rise to the top
based on price, usability and popularity. Its premise is simple, grab
any content type from files, including folders, documents, images,
URL&#39;s, text snippets to even web images from your browser with your
cursor, shake your mouse and a shelf appears on the screen where you can
park the item while you make your next move. You can also designate
folders to automatically create a shelf whenever a file is added, a
feature I use with my downloads folder.</p>

<p>Dropover is integrated with multiple cloud services. You can move items
from a shelf to iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, AWS, OneDrive and Imgur
and instantly receive a shareable link.</p>

<p>If you are gathering files from various locations, you can have multiple
shelfs open at once. Each shelf has a quick action menu that allow you
to use the share sheet or native menu to send the file by email, Airdrop
or Messages. Other file operations like image resizing, PDF stitching
and text extraction are also available.</p>

<p>To differentiate shelfs, you can give them custom names and colors.
Shelfs can be docked to the side of the display and temporarily hidden
until you need them. You can reopen your last 10 shelfs if you need to
reuse them. Items on the shelf can take advantage of Quicklook and you
can add to a shelf from the clipboard.  The developer has also added
Shortcut and Widget support to the app. There are keyboard shortcuts
available to create and use shelfs with using the mouse. There are even
<a href="https://www.raycast.com/jag-k/dropover">Raycast</a> and Alfred
integrations.</p>
