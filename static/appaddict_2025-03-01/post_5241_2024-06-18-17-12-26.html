<p><a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA writer</a> a markdown/plain text
editor designed especially for writing and document creation. It isn&#39;t a
text editor in the fashion of VS Code or BBEdit. If you aren&#39;t a
markdown wiz, all of the commands are accessible from the menu bar. The
simplified interface is its hallmark, but it has a variety of powerful
tools behind the curtains.</p>

<h2>Differentiating Authors  </h2>

<p>iA Writer can tint the text you paste into a document (i.e,. from an AI
source) differently than the text you type in so that you can
distinguish your writing from that of another author or AI.</p>

<h2>Syntax Highlighting  </h2>

<p>iA Writer uses color codes to showcase different parts of speech
(adjectives, nouns adverbs) and its built-in editor helps you identify
and get rid of filler words, cliches and redundancies.</p>

<h2>Focus Mode</h2>

<p>In focus mode, iA Writer highlights just the line or paragraph you are
working on to mimic the experience of using a typewriter. This allows
you a distraction free writing experience where you can concentrate on
your current idea.</p>

<h2>Linking</h2>

<p>iA Writer supports wikilinks to connect your documents. You can easily
move between documents by following links or using arrow buttons on the
toolbar.</p>

<h2>Publishing and Export</h2>

<p>iA Writer supports direct publishing to Ghost, Medium. Micro.blog,
Micropub and WordPress. You can export documents as Markdown, HTML, PDF
or Microsoft Word formatted documents. You can insert images into
documents via Markdown and as content blocks that can be seen in the
built in preview mode.</p>

<p>iA writer is developed by a well established Japan based team. It&#39;s been
around for awhile and continues to evolve. A desktop license is $49 and
separate license is required for use on an iPhone or iPad. Minor
upgrades are free. Major upgrades incur a cost. A free 15-day trial is
offered. <a href="https://ia.net/writer">Their website</a> says
subscription pricing for mac and iOS is coming.</p>
