      <p>Here are my favorite apps that have both a macOS and an iOS/iPadOS
version.</p>

<h2> <a href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/09/use-cases-for.html">Drafts </a>
</h2>

<p>I use Drafts for a great number of tasks. I collect quotes there until I
am ready to process them into my collection. Whenever i need to convert
HTML into markdown, it&#39;s as simple as pasting it into Drafts. On iOS it
serves as quick entry into Obsidian. On macOS it holds templates I
convert into reoccurring projects in my task manager.</p>

<a href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/06/09/my-favorite-things.html">Obsidian</a> </h2>

<p>Obsidian is my second brain. It contains notes relating to my job, my
writing and everything in between. I do most of my note creating on my
Mac, but I use it often on my phone for reference. The mobile app is
getting better and better but it still isn&#39;t quite there yet, thus my
reliance on Drafts for data entry.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scrap-paper">Scrap Paper</a> </h2>

<p>Scrap Paper is a floating notes app for macOS that synchronizes with
iOS. It can be summoned with a keyboard shortcut and the window stays on
top of other windows. You can manually run a sync if the automatic sync
isn&#39;t fast enough. Whenever I need to manipulate text I do it in Scrap
Paper because it&#39;s always there in the menu bar waiting for me.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/things-3-maybe-the-pinnacle-in-app-design">Things 3</a> </h2>

<p>Things 3 is the award winning, highly regarded task manager from Culture
Code that can be used for simple lists on one end of the spectrum and
complex projects on the other end. Every day starts and ends for me
reviewing Things 3 on whatever device I happen to be on.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/battle-of-the-clipboard-managers">PastePal</a> </h2>

<p>I go back and forth between using Raycast and PastePal for my clipboard
management needs. PastePal has the advantage of being cross platform and
iOS synced so that things I copy on my work computer are available to me
on my home computer and phone, a feature Raycast does not have.</p>

<h2><a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/anylist-for-recipes-shopping-and-more">Anylist </a></h2>

<p>My choice for several lifestyle categories is Anylist. it&#39;s my grocery
shopping list, my recipe management app and my packing list compiler.
Not only are there macOS and iOS versions, there is also a web interface
where I can get to my info from anywhere.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/09/microsoft-edge-really.html">Edge</a> </h2>

<p>I know some of you are pressing the downvote button right now while
shaking your head but hear me out. I started using Edge when I was on a
PC at work and a Mac at home. I stuck with it because I work in a
Microsoft 365 environment. Its syncing between computers and devices is
rock solid. It has the extensions I need and it has a unique feature
called collections which is very handy when I don&#39;t want to bookmark a
page but want to reference later. It also has profiles and workspaces
that neatly separate my person stuff from my work stuff. Don&#39;t hate. I
have reasons.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/sequel-entertainment-database">Sequel</a> </h2>

<p>Keeping track of upcoming TV shows can be a job and I&#39;m just as liable
to hear a good suggestion at work as I am home. I keep track of my
unified watch list in  the feature rich app, Sequel, which also tracks
books, audiobooks, movies and video games.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/play-save-videos-watch-later">Play</a> </h2>

<p>Play is a four platform threat because your App Store purchase also
gives you access to the Apple TV app. Play is a watch-it-later app for
YouTube that also allows for subscribing to cahnnels and extensive
filtering and tagging. It has multiple ways to add videos to your
playlist on iOS and macOS.</p>

<h2>
<a href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/day-one-is-popular-for-a-reason">Day One</a>  </h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been using Day One for over ten years and I have 18,000 entries in
the journaling app. Using IFTTT integrations I have included almost my
entire Twitter history, blog posts, scale readings, GPS tracks, and
thousands of photos. I can add to it on the fly from my phone and do
derious curation at night or the weekend on my Mac.</p>

<p><br />Like most members of the Apple ecosystem, I use iOS and macOS
depending on the environment. I also use an iPad from time to time. A
universal app, according to most definitions is an app you pay for one
time and then can use on any Apple platform. Some apps have a separate
price per platform. For the purpose of this review, I have included both
types.</p>
