<p><br />I recently saw a recommendation for <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/iboysoft-magicmenu/id1599191594?mt=12">MagicMenu
from iBoysoft</a> on Reddit and decided to try out the app. According to
my records, it&#39;s the 1663rd app I have purchased from Apple, and it is
the first one that I have ever requested a refund on. The app actually
works as described, but the information on its free trial and cost of a
yearly subscription was wrong. As soon as I installed the app, I
received a message that the free trial was expired. I&#39;ve never installed
it before, so it wasn&#39;t a case of previously using it. When I decided to
purchase a one-year subscription, I was billed $19.99 rather than the
$9.99 it clearly states as the price in the product description on the
app store.</p>

<p>The app is designed to add functionality to the right-click context menu
in Finder. It only works in Finder and nowhere else. It adds the
following functions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a shortcut to create a new file</li>
<li>Add a folder shortcut to Copy To</li>
<li>Add a shortcut to Quick Access to an Item</li>
<li>Quickly move or send files to a certain location</li>
<li>Completely uninstall unwanted applications</li>
<li>Find duplicate files and clean up</li>
<li>Detect similar photos and clean up</li>
<li>Find junk files and clean up</li>
<li>Compress files to archive them</li>
</ul>

<p><br />Almost all of these actions are found in my preferred file
manager, <a href="https://www.cocoatech.io/">Path Finder</a> or in
single purpose utilities like <a
href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/">App Cleaner</a>, the native
Photos app, <a
href="https://fiplab.com/apps/duplicate-detective-for-mac">Duplicate
Detective</a> and <a href="https://www.keka.io/en/">Keka</a>. Other
Finder replacements, like <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/commander-one-file-manager/id1035236694?mt=12">Commander
One</a> offer custom right-click menus as well. If you just want right
click actions in the finder, <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/qmenu/id1567442612?mt=12">Qmenu</a>
is only $.99, and <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/tomenu-new-move-file-quickly/id1414457383?mt=12is">2menu</a>
is $2.99, although both are from Chinese developers if that gives you
pause.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t ordinarily write negative reviews but there were just too many
red flags on this app and not enough value for something with a
relatively high subscription price.</p>
