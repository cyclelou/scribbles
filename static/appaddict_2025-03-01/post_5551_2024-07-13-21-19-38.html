<p>Since Authy deprecated its desktop app and has also been recently hit by
security breaches, you may be looking for a replacement two-factor
authentication solution. Step 2 from indy developer Neil Sardesai
provides you a way to scan QR codes from websites offering two-factor
authentication via time based one-time passwords (TOTP) to log in, sites
like Facebooks, Evernote, Twitter, Reddit, Notion and others. Using this
method allows you remain safe even if your password gets compromised
since it&#39;s based on factor one, something you know - your password, and
factor two, something you have, your computer with an authenticator app.
There are several well-known and widely used authenticator apps for
iPhones, Microsoft Authenticator and Google Authenticator are two. Step
2 is iCloud based so it works across devices. Step 2 is an
iOS/iPad-based app, so it only works on Apple silicon-based Macs.</p>

<p>Step 2 is free to try in a limited way <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/step-two/id1291130842">from the App
Store</a>. An unlimited license is $9.99. </p>

<p>Another player in the field is Raivo OTP, but its latest reviews are
very, very poor and I can&#39;t recommend it.</p>
