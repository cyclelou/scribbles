<p><br />Use the free tool, <a
href="https://peacockmedia.software/mac/integrity/free.html">Integrity</a>,
to quickly crawl an entire domain or subdomain and check every link on
each page within. See a report listing the URL of each page and see the
server response code for all internal and external links found. From
within Integrity you can quickly jump to any page within the domain and
with the text of the broken link highlighted.</p>

<p>As corporate owned social media becomes more toxic and advertising
invades every space available, more and more people are adopting the
ethos of the Indie Web movement and creating their own websites in the
form of personal blogs hosted on various independent platforms. Some opt
for WordPress sites with complicated plugins and CDN management, while
others use services that are basically online editors that operate like
word processors with a &quot;publish&quot; button, like <a
href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>. For anyone interested in
maintaining their own web presence, the bar to entry is low with domain
registrations costing under $10 a year and blog  hosting as low as $1 a
month..</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>One of the things that happens over time to all websites is link rot.
Linking to news articles and other bloggers invariable results in links
breaking over time as companies go out of business, switch URLs or
simply remove content. It can be frustrating to people visiting a site
to run into many broken links and if you are interested in appearing in
search engine results, you&#39;ll find that sites with link rot get
downgraded.</p>

<p>Integrity, an app under continuous development since 2007 and was
updated just this week. On a domain I own that contains two blogs, the
crawler found 1717 pages and 3498 links. There were about a dozen 404
errors from websites that had closed down and social media posts that
had been deleted. I also found an issue with Cloudflare and the way my
blog host handles hashtags that led me to open a ticket.</p>

<p>Integrity is a free link checker best suited for personal blogs or
smaller websites. The same developer has similar tools for professional
use. More features and options such as exporting your data,
authentication (logging in), managing multiple sites, sitemap
generation, SEO checks, spelling &amp; grammar are all available in two
related apps; <a
href="https://peacockmedia.software/mac/integrity-plus/">Integrity
Plus</a> and <a
href="https://peacockmedia.software/mac/scrutiny/">Scrutiny</a>. <a
href="https://peacockmedia.software/mac/integrity/">Here is a comparison
of major features</a></p>

<p>Integrity is available from the <a
href="https://peacockmedia.software/mac/integrity/free.html">developer&#39;s
website</a> or the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/integrity/id513610341">Mac App
Store.</a></p>
