<p>When I started a new job a couple of years ago doing end user IT support
at a small, private university, I was assigned a Dell all-in-one PC with
Windows 10 after being primarily a Mac user at home and work for over
two decades. There are a few Macs on campus but overwhelmingly our users
are PC based. When I started, I intuited that Edge had good integration
with Microsoft 365, so I chose to use it despite having been primarily a
Safari and Chrome user in the past. I can use any browser I want. My
coworkers in the IT department use Brave, Firefox and Chrome but after
my initial choice I decided to stick with Edge and in fact made it my
default browser on my iPhone and my personal M2 MacBook Air. I recently
started using an M3 iMac at work, but I&#39;m sticking with Edge.</p>

<p>Why, you ask? Because despite what the world seems to believe, Edge
really doesn&#39;t suck. In fact, it&#39;s variety of features make it one of my
favorite pieces of software to use. Is it perfect? No. Like most
Chromium based browsers it could use less memory, although it is much
better than Chrome. As a heavy user of Apple&#39;s Shortcuts app on my phone
and Mac, I find that most browser related workflows are written for
Safari and don&#39;t work as well in Edge. Still, the good overwhelmingly
outweighs the bad. Edge has quite a few features that are cutting edge,
if not unique.</p>

<h2>Profiles</h2>

<p><br />I have separate profiles for home and work. At work Edge, when
signed into Microsoft 365 is managed, meaning I can install no
extensions and save no passwords, but I do have ready access to all my
documents in OneDrive, my Outlook email accounts our campus Intranet and
more. I have a set of work-related bookmarks I use with this profile. I
simultaneously open another browser window signed into a different
Microsoft account and voila, I then have access to all my extensions, a
different set of bookmarks and my bookmark manager of choice, which also
holds my credit card info in case I need to buy anything through the
browser. I use the same personal profile at home so I can save things I
want to reference at work in my extra browser window.</p>

<h2>Workspaces</h2>

<p><br />Within a profile, users can create collections, browser setups for
unique use cases. I have one for general browsing with my go to
collection of bookmarks in the bookmark (or favorites as Edge calls
them) bar. I have another setup for blogging with a different set of
bookmarks available in the bookmarks bar. Both workspaces share the same
general set of bookmarks from the menu bar or toolbar button, so I don&#39;t
have to worry about syncing two collections. Tabs can be set to be
remembered between sessions, so when I&#39;m ready to work on a blog entry,
I have tabs for <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, <a
href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>, and <a
href="https://social.lol/@amerpie">my Mastodon account</a>. It&#39;s all
really handy and allows me to just open up the browser and go to work.</p>

<h2>Extensions</h2>

<p><br />Edge can use the same extensions available to Google Chrome and
there&#39;s a vast selection to choose from. I don&#39;t find that running all
the extensions I need slows Edge down appreciably, so I install what I
need. Extensions are specific to the profile you are using, but
workspaces within the same profile share the same extensions. You can
create a different Mac and PC profile is you find yourself using
extensions that are platform specific. Here&#39;s what I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://omnivore.app/">Omnivore</a> - It's the best read it later service around these days, featuring a mobile app with read aloud capability, newsletter subscription service, RSS feeds and a browser extension.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/markdownload-markdown-web-clipper/173">Obsidian Web Clipper</a> - I primarily use a <a href="https://gist.github.com/extratone/7a881fff3c9472f607c4730be08b1c87">bookmarklet</a> for saving web content into <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> on my Mac, but I use a different vault at work on my PC where Drafts isn't available.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://app.raindrop.io/">Raindrop.io</a> - I have a subscription and heartily endorse Raindrop.io for its cross-platform support  </li>
<li>
<a href="https://aboard.com/">Aboard</a> - This is the extension for the app my wife and I use to share links with each other. When I find an app, a TV show, a news story or whatever, I put it into Aboard and she gets a notification and can check it out when she has time. It's free and useful.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://remotedesktop.google.com/">Chrome Remote Desktop</a> - This allows me to access my home computer from other locations. It's free, easy to set up and use and reliable. I don't know what people pay for Screens or TeamViewer subscriptions.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">UBlock Origin</a>- The best ad blocker on the planet. 31,000,000 downloads can't be wrong.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.gettoby.com/">Toby</a> - My new tab extension. It makes it easy to save and open windows full of tabs on the go. I use the free version and even though I maintain my <a href="https://start.me/">start.me</a> page, I stick with Toby for new tabs.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/velja/gpipdgcamiclkcomcnogmlfpalggmcmk">Velja</a>- Works in conjunction with the Mac app of the same name to open URLs in other bowsers and apps (e.g., Slack, Teams, Zoom, Freetube etc)</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Collections</h2>

<p><br />One of the features in Edge I find really useful is available on
the desktop and mobile version of the browser. You can create
collections of bookmarks on the fly for things you want to investigate
later but don&#39;t necessarily want to save forever. I have five
collections:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Shopping</strong> - this is mostly a collection of Amazon pages I can keep separate from my Amazon wish list so my wife can't see what I was thinking of getting her for her birthday</li>
<li>
<strong>Software</strong> - I'm an unembarrassed software nerd, always looking for the latest cool program to try out. I keep a running collection of pages of programs I want to look at.</li>
<li>
<strong>Windows</strong> - Most of my leisure browsing happens on my mac, but when I find something that might be useful on my day job, I save it to my Windows collection to investigate at work</li>
<li>
<strong>TV</strong> - When I come across a review of an upcoming television show, I add it to this collection. Once a week I read all the emails from streaming services and the web pages I've collected and i cultivate the viewing list for my wife and I</li>
<li>
<strong>Reading List</strong> - I use a read it later app (Omnivore) but sometimes I just add a news article or How-to guide to my reading list collection if it's something I know I'll just read in my browser.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>Other features I like</h2>

<p><br />As I mentioned earlier, one of the best kept secrets of using a
computer in 2024 is the free access to Chat-GPT4 built into <a
href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Bing/CoPilot</a>. There are people
out there paying $20 a month to do what they can do for free with
CoPilot and it&#39;s built right into Edge. I personally have an API
subscription to Open.AI, which runs me about a dollar a month so I can
use the API key in other apps like Raycast and Obsidian.</p>

<p>The mobile version of Edge is good enough to be my default browser in
iOS 17. Edge has a feature to send tabs to other devices and I use it
all the time between my work computer, phone and MacBook at home. I have
full access to my browser bookmarks on my phone as well as my history.
Since I use a separate app for passwords, I don&#39;t worry about browser
saved passwords.</p>

<p>I know that Safari introduced profiles last year with the release of
Sonoma and I know Chrome has access to the same browser extensions, but
I just find that in my environment - supporting Windows at work, Mac at
home and consistent iPhone use, Edge has a set of features that work
reliably for me. The browser receives constant updates and allows users
to download separate beta and canary versions if they want. Hopefully
you&#39;ve found something in this review that might give you a reason to
give Edge a tryout.</p>
