<p>The easiest way to share files between computers or with other users is
through a commercial cloud service like iCloud, Dropbox or Google Drive.
The problem with using those services is that your data passes through
someone else&#39;s computer. If you are sharing apple pie recipes with your
Aunt Sue, that&#39;s not a problem, but if your data is ultra-private
documents like financial records, proprietary business information or
the like, you should consider a product like <a
href="https://www.resilio.com/sync/\#Features">Resilio Sync</a>, formerly
a commercial product, now free for personal use.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.resilio.com/sync/\#Features">Resilio Sync </a>allows
you to sync data between computers and to selectively share files with
others. There are clients for Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and
several NAS configurations. You can &quot;easily send one or more files to
multiple recipients without sharing the whole folder or creating a
permanent sync connection. Send photos, videos, movies, or any other
large file directly to friends. Cloud free.</p>

<p>You can make sure sensitive data stays in your control. Change access
permissions at any time using the ‘Advanced Folders’ feature. You can
assign ownership to another user, revoke access, or modify read and
write permissions on the fly. Sync has built in encryption.</p>

<p>Automatically sync folders to all your devices. Sync photos, videos,
music, PDFs, docs or any other file types to/from your mobile phone,
laptop, or other storage devices.</p>

<p>Using <strong><em>‘Selective Sync’</em></strong> feature, Sync will
create placeholder files in your file-system that can be searched
locally. Click to download only the files that you need, when you need
them, without having to replicate entire folders on every device.</p>

<p>If you have bandwidth issues, you can set limits on download and upload
speeds</p>
