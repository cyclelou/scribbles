<p>When I began my career in Mac support, my first task was replacing hard
drives in hundreds of Mac LC 575s along with adding an Ethernet card
because we were getting Internet access in every classroom. It was a
heady time. The new computers we were purchasing were Bondi Blue first
generation G3 iMacs. Having come from the PC world, I needed reference
material for all the new hardware I was being presented. One of my
co-workers told me about <a href="https://mactracker.ca/">MacTracker</a>
and for the last quarter of a century I&#39;ve had a copy of this great app
installed on every Mac I have ever owned or been assigned.</p>

<p>MacTracker is a stand-alone hardware and software database of every Mac
model that&#39;s even been made. It gives you info on:</p>

<ul>
<li>processor speed</li>
<li>memory</li>
<li>graphic cards</li>
<li>supported OS versions</li>
<li>price</li>
<li>storage</li>
<li>expansion options</li>
</ul>

<p>MacTracker provides information on more than just laptops, desktops and
servers. It also covers:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>Apple Watch and</li>
<li>Apple Vision Pro</li>
<li>Newton</li>
<li>Apple TV</li>
<li>Apple accessories</li>
<li>audio displays</li>
<li>modems</li>
<li>printers scanners</li>
<li>storage</li>
<li>Wi-Fi products</li>
<li>operating systems</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have even a passing interest in Mac history, you owe it to
yourself to download and peruse this free app. If you are considering
tinkering with vintage models, you definitely need this. The program
lets you add computers to a section called &quot;My Models&quot; if you want to
compare the different Macs you own or have used. It has limited serial
number lookups if you are unsure of the model you are working on. You
can link to MacTracker from other apps. Each model listed has
information on whether it is considered still in support, vintage or
obsolete.</p>
