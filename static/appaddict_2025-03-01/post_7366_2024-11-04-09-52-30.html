<p><br />I bought <a href="https://www.mothsoftware.com/">Mail Archiver X
</a>by Moth Software at a discount from Bundlehunt a few months back and
didn&#39;t have to pay the full $49.95 they charge on their website. My
intention was to keep a regularly updated archive of my 19-year-old
Gmail account containing 155K messages. I also wanted to retrieve a
Yahoo account that I use solely for newsletters.</p>

<p>I knew beforehand that it&#39;s extremely easy to use Google Takeout to
download an archive of your email in the universally recognized mbox
format because I&#39;ve done it several times. My Gmail archive weighs in at
about 8GBs. You don&#39;t get a lot of choices when you request the archive,
though. You get it all from the beginning of time. I wanted one to
import into Eagle Filer so that I could have offline access to all the
receipts, registration information and other things I&#39;d received via
email since 2005. Google Takeout did the trick.</p>

<p>With Mail Archiver X you can filter the emails you choose to archive, a
feature I wanted. Unfortunately, despite supposedly being able to add
files to an archive and cumulatively grow it over time, I was never able
to get that function to work. Either the program insisted on downloading
an entire archive each time it ran, taking hours, or it only downloaded
files since the last time I ran it, but in a new file, so that I could
not search my entire account at one time. Their tech support answered my
emails, but not with helpful information. The company is not in the US
and the person who answered my email did not appear to a native English
speaker. At present, support is no longer free. They have a $70 fee.</p>

<p>The other thing about the app I don&#39;t care for is its size. It&#39;s over
half a GB. That&#39;s just the program, not the archives it creates. I would
never recommend this program to anyone.</p>
