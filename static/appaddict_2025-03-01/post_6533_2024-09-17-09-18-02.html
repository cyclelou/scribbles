<p><br />Evernote was once a giant of an app, beloved by millions and one
of the first cross platform tools to achieve widespread use. The
productivity culture adored it and people like Tiago Forte, the author
Building a Second Brain, made it central to their methodology. The
company was sold to Italian developers Bending in Spoons in 2022, firing
almost all of the US staff. It went incommunicado for months. Evernote&#39;s
dwindling user base didn&#39;t know what to do.</p>

<p>When the company did begin to communicate again, it was to announce a
gargantuan price hike and the gutting of their once extremely popular
free plan. Today, the cheapest plan is $130 a year. The free plan is
limited to 50 notes on one device. Although legacy users can still
access all the notes they created in the past, many complain that the
user experience is marred by constant pop-ups asking them to become
paying customers. The Evernote subreddit is almost all complaints and
people asking for ideas on alternatives.</p>

<p>To its credit, Bending Spoons has made a valiant effort in 2024 to add
extra value for its remaining subscribers. Calendar integration now
includes Google and Outlook. Other new features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Table of contents</li>
<li>Daily Notes</li>
<li>Slash commands</li>
<li>Quote blocks</li>
<li>Collapsible Notes</li>
<li>Revamped mobile app</li>
<li>Redesigned tasks</li>
<li>File management</li>
<li>Voice-to-text</li>
<li>Improved import features</li>
<li>Metadata improvements</li>
</ul>

<p><br />Many former users have moved to free and low-cost alternatives
like Obsidian, Joplin, Notion and One Note. I am currently in what will
be the last year of an Evernote subscription. I migrated most of my 7000
notes accumulated since 2008 to Obsidian months ago. It&#39;s nice to see
what Bending Spoons is doing with the app, but it&#39;s not worth what they
ask for a subscription.</p>
