<p>I have long relied on the Mac power user&#39;s file management automation
app <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel by Noodlesoft</a> to
handle tag related tasks for me, but at $42 for a single user license,
it might be a little rich for some who don&#39;t need all of its
functionality.  For those who simply want to automate some of their
basic tagging chores, <a href="https://littletagger.com/">Little
Tagger</a> by indy developer Dennis Schäfer, which I just learned about,
might just do the trick but read carefully.</p>

<p>Little Tagger works from saved profiles you create based on a menu-based
interface. The profiles are saved presets that are reusable. Tagging
works in single files or on whole folder trees you drag into the program
interface or import via a keyboard combo. It defaults to the last used
profile, but you can easily delay execution to edit the profile or
select a different one. Not only can Little Tagger add tags to files, it
can also remove them. It uses your already created finder tags as a base
but allows you to create new ones with having to go to Finder to do so.
Little Tagger features a tag cloud feature that you can activate and use
to drag and drop files onto. If you&#39;re partial to a keyboard centric
workflow, you can do almost every action in the app without touching the
mouse.</p>

<p>One drawback to the program is that it has not been updated since 2022.
The <a href="https://littletagger.com">developer&#39;s web site</a> has
information about a fuller featured product he&#39;s working on, but it
appears to be separate app and not an upgrade. No pricing info for the
new app is offered, but there appear to be beta invitations available.
Little Tracker&#39;s privacy policy states that the developer does not track
any data at all from the app. It is an $8.99 one-time purchase <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/little-tagger/id1561643278">in the
App Store</a>.  My recommendation would be to see if you can get in on
the beta of the developer&#39;s app in progress unless he updates this one
before then.</p>
