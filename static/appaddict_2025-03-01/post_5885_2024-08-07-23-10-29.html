<p>Every once in a while, an app is so well received that an entire
community grows up around it. Evernote used to be like that before it
started to suck. Obsidian is like that, just look at the YouTube videos
and blogs. I&#39;ve recently discovered that Twos, a combination calendar,
to-do, notes plus collaboration and social media app has a devoted
following and quite a large community in its built in &quot;Twos World&quot;
feature and on Discord.</p>

<p>I have to say that the app is beautifully designed and it&#39;s theme-able.
It is free to use . It&#39;s cross platform, so not only can you use it on a
Mac, it can be accessed on iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and Chrome
extensions (for Chromebooks). Unlike Notion, a competitor, Twos can be
used offline and will sync when connectivity is reestablished. It
generates a new list for &quot;things&quot; every day. That&#39;s what it calls its
data points whether they be notes, calendar events, or todos. Its
interface lends itself very well to bullet journaling.</p>

<p>It&#39;s todo lists offers tasks and subtasks and it supports Siri shortcuts
so you can verbally add data. Unfinished items automatically carryover
to the next day. You can set auto-reminders for todos or calendar
events.  Its calendars import from Google, Apple and Outlook. They can
also write to those calendars. You can share you lists via links even
with people who don&#39;t have the app. Twos supports text only data entry
via email, texts and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>Some advanced features can either be purchased or earned through the
in-app gamification of earning coins by using certain features,
referring friends or participating in Twos World, the built in community
feature. The purchase price is low though, $1.99 per feature for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hyperlinks</li>
<li>Alerts</li>
<li>Weekly reports</li>
<li>Suggested times</li>
<li>Sublists</li>
<li>AI</li>
</ul>

<p><br />They also offer a quasi-subscription/donation option to let you
gain access to any new features or just to support future development.
It&#39;s available on the<a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twos-remember-share-things/id1097350934">
Mac App Store </a>or at <a href="https://www.twosapp.com/home">the
developer&#39;s website.</a> If you want to do me a solid, <a
