<p><br />For anyone looking for an anonymous messaging system, that
requires no account, email or telephone number to set up, <a
href="https://getsession.org/">Session</a> may be what you are looking
for. With clients for macOS, iOS, Windows, Android and Linux, you can
communicate with just about anyone through a network of 2000
decentralized servers. If a server goes down, the network stays up,
eliminating any one node as a single source of failure.</p>

<p>Session&#39;s encrypted messages are sent through an onion routing network.
Onion networks encrypt messages with multiple layers of encryption, then
send them through a number of nodes. Each node ‘unwraps’ (decrypts) a
layer of encryption, meaning that no single node ever knows both the
destination and origin of the message. Session uses onion routing to
ensure that a server which receives a message never knows the IP address
of the sender.</p>

<p>Account in Session are created and secured with a mnemonic seed which
can be used to restore your existing Account ID to a new device. Your
display name can be anything you want it to be. Session does not collect
any geolocation data, metadata, or any other data about the device or
network you are using. On your local device, Session allows you to
encrypt your local Session database with a PIN code. With this feature
turned on, your messages cannot be accessed without knowing your PIN
code. If the police or a thief have physical access to your device, they
still can&#39;t see your messages without your PIN.</p>

<p>Voice and video messaging are current beta features in the app. In early
2025, the back end technology for the app is transitioning to upgraded
technology, using crypto-based engineering. Although there are no paid
features currently, <a href="https://session.foundation/">the non-profit
foundation</a> behind the app says that it may implement some in the
future, using cryptocurrency. They say the primary private messaging
will always be free.</p>
