<p>For many, the desire to watch all of the latest shows on streaming
channels is complicated by the expense of multiple subscriptions. It
seems like every month one or more of the channels I subscribe to is
raising their price or instituting advertising that I have to pay to opt
out of. The smartest strategy to cope with this is to only have active
subscriptions to the channels you&#39;re going to be watching during a given
period. With channels renewing on different days and some programs being
released once a week vs. others being dropped all at once, it can be
difficult to map out a strategy that makes sense, but as we used to say
in the olden days, there&#39;s an app for that.</p>

<p>Seasons, released in April 2024 walks you through a setup process that
has you adding shows from your various watchlists, then adding your
channel subscriptions along with their cost and renewal dates. It will
tell you how much you are spending per day for your current
subscriptions. It will also calculate for you when you should
unsubscribe and resubscribe from various channels to maximize your
entertainment dollar. You can add both current and upcoming shows as
well as movies. Unfortunately, it does not import watchlists, so you
will have to add everything manually. On the flip side, you don&#39;t have
to use other apps to add shows and Seasons has its own recommendation
algorithm based on your interests and user ratings.</p>

Seasons has a lifetime license available for $3.99 on the app store.</a></p>
