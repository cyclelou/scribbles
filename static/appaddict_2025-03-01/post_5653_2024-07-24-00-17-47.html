<p><br />I&#39;ve tried a variety of task manager apps over the years: <a
href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a>, <a
href="https://www.2doapp.com/mac">2Do</a>, <a
href="https://evernote.com/features/tasks">Evernote</a>, <a
href="https://www.icloud.com/reminders">Apple Reminders</a>, <a
href="https://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>, <a
href="https://www.toodledo.com/">ToodleDo</a>, <a
href="https://to-do.office.com/tasks/">Wunderlist/Microsoft To Do</a>,
<a href="https://support.google.com/tasks/answer/7675772?hl=en">Google
Tasks</a>. I&#39;ve also tried managing things personally and professionally
without a task manager and just trying really hard to remember
everything, LOL. Sob.</p>

<p>I spent the most time and money on Omnifocus. Not only did I purchase
the Mac, iPad and iOS versions, I also bought books, online courses and
training videos.  I was managing the computer networks and workstation
inventory of five large high schools with multiple work orders per site
along with outsourced repairs, AV equipment, supporting the cafeteria
POS systems and the front office student information system. My point is
my job generated a lot of work for me to keep track of. Unfortunately,
Omnifocus was not the right tool. It was too rigid, too technical and
just too, too much.</p>

<p>I retired from public education in 2020 and now work in a low stress
environment at a private university smaller than some of the high
schools I used to manage. I&#39;m not in charge of anything, I just provide
end user support. It is glorious. I use <a
href="https://culturedcode.com/things/features/">Things 3</a> as a task
manager these days. I have it on my personal Mac, my work machine, my
iPhone and my iPad. <a
href="https://culturedcode.com/things/features/">Things 3</a> is a
two-time Apple design award winner. One of the best parts about using a
Mac is visually appealing, well-designed software. Reviews for <a
href="https://culturedcode.com/things/features/">Things 3</a> are
universally positive from respected tech outlets like Mac Stories, The
Verge, Wirecutter, The Sweet Setup, Wired, iMore, The Brooks Review and
the App Store Editor&#39;s Choice.</p>

<p><strong>Things 3 does everything I need:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Import from Apple Reminders where I use voice commands and Siri to create to dos, </li>
<li>Let me create areas of responsibility (e.g., work home, errands)</li>
<li>Extensive tagging of tasks and projects</li>
<li>Different dates for starting and completing tasks</li>
<li>Repeating Tasks</li>
<li>Workday/Evening tasks for the same day</li>
<li>Easy to view upcoming tasks</li>
<li>Integration with other productivity apps like Obsidian, Drafts, Raycast and Shortcuts</li>
<li>Keyboard driven</li>
<li>Easy to use quick find function</li>
<li>Private cloud syncing</li>
</ul>

<p><br />There are three areas to consider about <a
href="https://culturedcode.com/things/features/">Things 3</a> that don&#39;t
cause big smiley faces:</p>

<ul>
<li>It does not have location-based reminders via geofencing</li>
<li>It has not had a major version update in several years</li>
<li>Each app must be bought separately per OS: macOS- $49.99. iPadOS - $19.99, iOS.Apple Watch - $9.99</li>
</ul>

<p><br />And, of course, there is that one guy on Reddit who really doesn&#39;t
like it. There is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thingsapp/">a whole
community</a> there of folks devoted to it.</p>

<p>But, the Reddit guy is easy to ignore. The lack of geofencing is
bothersome but there are work arounds. The product has had numerous
incremental upgrades and is in a mature design stage. As far as the
cost, well, it is on par with other professional level apps. Omnifocus
Pro is $149.99 to cover every platform.</p>

<p>If you want to use technology to manage your life&#39;s task and you want to
use one of the best designed Mac programs in existence, get <a
href="https://culturedcode.com/things/features/">Things 3</a>.</p>
