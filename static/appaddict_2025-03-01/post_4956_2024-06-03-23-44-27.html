<p><br />In the modern age, it takes a real strategy to protect yourself
from invasive mega-corporations who want to track you, bad actors on the
malware front and in your face non-stop advertising. Whatever tools you
choose have to balance with usability because we all have work we have
to get done.</p>

<p><strong>Nord VPN</strong></p>

<p>My first level of protection starts with my VPN choice, <a
href="https://ref.nordvpn.com/vLNoqIdRIkB">Nord</a>. I run Nord on all
my devices, Macs, iPhones, iPads and Apple TV. I don&#39;t have a compatible
router, but it can be installed on ones that are. Nord has many security
features including a malicious URL blocker, web tracker blocker, ad
blocker, URL trimmer and a DNS filter to block ads and malicious domains
before they reach my device.</p>

<p>Before I got a VPN, I used <a href="https://www.opendns.com/">Open
DNS</a>, which I can highly recommend for some basic protections (but
without the privacy features).</p>

<p><strong>Little Snitch Firewall</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html">Little
Snitch</a> from Objective Development is truly the most configurable
consumer oriented firewall for the Mac platform. The Little Snitch
Network Monitor shows you where your Mac connects to on the Internet.
You decide what you want to allow or deny. If an app has no need to
access the Internet, you can cut off its access. It&#39;s easy to use and
configure and as a bonus, you can download and install preconfigured
block lists from several sources to make your computer safe.</p>

<p>Other firewall options are <a
href="https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html">Lulu</a> from
Objective-See and <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/lockdown-privacy-desktop">Lockdown
Privacy Desktop</a>, which is what I install on my Mom&#39;s Mac because it
is set it and for get it.</p>

<p><strong>Block-Block for Realtime Protection<br /></strong><br /><a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/blockblock-and-knockknock-from-objective-see">BlockBlock
</a>monitors common persistence locations and alerts whenever a
persistent component is added. It alerts you whenever something is
installed and you can decide whether to allow that or block it. It&#39;s a
free product. You can get more features in the paid version of <a
href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac">MalwareBytes </a>or use their
free scanner that must be run manually.</p>

<p><strong>uBlock Origin for Browser Based Protection</strong></p>

<p>There are many factors that go into making a selection of what browser
to use. I personally use Microsoft Edge <a
href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/09/microsoft-edge-really.html">for
several reasons</a>. I use the uBlock origin multi-spectrum content
blocker plugin to block ads, trackers, malicious URLs and more. Among
the most security conscious Mac users who don&#39;t need to use a Chromium
browser, it is generally accepted that <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox
with uBlock Origin</a> provides the best experience. Upcoming changes in
Chromium browser plugin specifications, known as Manifest 3, may weaken
the effectiveness of uBlock Origin on Chrome and Edge.</p>

<p>These products all work together to provide as safe an environment as I
feel I can craft on my Mac. If you have ideas for improvement, please
contact me. </p>
