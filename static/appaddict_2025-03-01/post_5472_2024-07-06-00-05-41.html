<p>The journaling app, Day One by Bloom Built Software, a subsidiary of
Automattic, has been downloaded 15 million times and it has 200,000
five-star reviews. It is a consistent design award winner. I&#39;ve been
using it for 10 years; I have five journals and nearly 18,000 entries. </p>

<h2>My journals are:</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Exercise</strong> - auto entries from the calendar created by my exercise app</li>
<li>
<strong>Gratitude</strong> - manual entries of three bullet points a day</li>
<li>
<strong>News</strong> - auto entries created by tagged read-it-later articles</li>
<li>
<strong>Eating Out</strong> - manual entries</li>
<li>
<strong>Journal</strong> - a mix of manual and automated entries from many different sources</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2>My automated entries (via IFTTT) include:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Daily weather report</li>
<li>TV shows and movies watched</li>
<li>My Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon posts</li>
<li>The RSS feeds from my different blogs</li>
</ul>

<p><br />I use a Keyboard Maestro macro to copy a Markdown version of my
daily note from Obsidian into Day One each night. All of the formatting
transfers over. I feel confident in the privacy of my entries based on
Day One&#39;s end to end encryption. The introduction of Apple&#39;s Journaling
App did nothing but add to the functionality of Day One, as it now has
the same prompting features.</p>

<p>I routinely add photos of my grandchildren texted to me by my kids using
the share sheet on the iOS version. I have nearly 20,000 saved locations
in my history and it&#39;s easy to create a backdated entry from one of
them. I have several templates ranging from restaurant meals, to daily
reviews. I have exported PDF yearly journals that I&#39;ve created through
the Day One export feature. Although I&#39;ve never purchased a printer
journal, they are very popular.</p>

<p>Day One is FREE to use forever with unlimited entries. Additional
features, including unlimited photos, videos, and sync are available
with a Day One Premium membership. A yearly subscription to Day One is
$35. It&#39;s a universal app with availability on the Mac, iPhone and iPad.
I&#39;ve never lost any data.</p>

<p>One of my favorite features is &quot;<em>On This Day</em>&quot;, a look back at
what I was doing on this date in years past. It gets better every year
as I increase the number of entries I have recorded in the app.</p>
