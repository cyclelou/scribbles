<p><br />Although I use a lot of apps that have a menu bar interface, most
of them are hidden by Bartender. An app has to be super useful and be
something I use frequently to remain visible at all times. The latest
addition by Sindre Sorhus, Supercharge is an instant add. It has a great
many uses and has replaced other utilities that have narrower focus.
More tools are being added regularly, so if you have this app, make sure
to install updates as soon as they are released to get new features. I
won&#39;t cover them all, just the ones I use personally.</p>

<h2>From the Menu Bar</h2>

<p>The menu bar icon presents the following option in a drop-down:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hide all windows</li>
<li>Show Desktop</li>
<li>Quit All Apps</li>
<li>Hide My Email (opens this buried item in System Settings)</li>
<li>Private Relay opens this buried item in System Settings)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tweaks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Unminimize windows when app becomes active</li>
<li>Dim icons of hidden apps in the dock</li>
<li>Create new text file with Option+N</li>
<li>Open new files after naming</li>
<li>Auto-adjust column widths in Finder</li>
<li>Quit an app when closing its last Window (I don't usually like to mimic Micro$oft behavior, but I like this feature)</li>
<li>When clicking on an active icon in the dock, hide app</li>
<li>Add to Finder's context menu<ul>
<li>Copy path</li>
<li>Copy file name</li>
<li>Image dimensions</li>
<li>Make symlink</li>
<li>Move to...</li>
<li>Copy to...</li>
<li>Open in Terminal (for folders)</li>
</ul>

<p></li>
</ul></p>

<p>The ability to make those modifications in the Finder makes it much more
powerful.</p>

<h2>Shortcuts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Toggle desktop widgets</li>
<li>Open Passwords from menu bar</li>
<li>Hide all windows</li>
<li>Quit all apps (except menu bar apps)</li>
<li>Show desktop</li>
</ul>

<p>I was using the beta feature to close visible notifications which
definitely had a beta feel to it, until I discovered that Better Touch
Tool&#39;s implementation of this feature closes not just visible
notifications, but all existing ones. I&#39;m sure Sindre will get this
working similarly in future releases.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>I work on an MBA at home and an iMac for work. For apps that don&#39;t have
iCloud sync, using the export and import settings tool has been
extremely useful and has saved me a ton of time. It&#39;s also useful when I
want to experiment with how an app is set up, allowing me to revert
settings if I don&#39;t like what I get after changing things around.</p>

<p>You can get a fully functional copy of the app <a
href="https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge">here</a>. The only
limitation is a reminder to buy the app every 12 hours, and no automatic
updates. All data and settings carry over if you buy it.</p>

<p>I suggest you just go ahead and buy the app. If there was ever an
Instabuy, this is it.</p>
