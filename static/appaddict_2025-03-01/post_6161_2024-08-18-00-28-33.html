<p>Start by Innovative Bytes is an app launcher with extra features that
make it different enough from <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/folder-peek-ftw">FolderPeek</a> 
and <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/xmenu-free-menu-bar-app-launcher">XMenu</a>
to be worth checking out. Like the other two apps, it offers a way to
access your favorite apps, folders, files and URLs from the menu bar. It
also lets you access your shortcuts, which is a welcome addition. Like
the Apple Menu, you can add recent files, recent apps as well as running
apps to your menu choices.</p>

<p>What really makes Start different is its use of tags. It uses Spotlight
to assign a few of your apps to tags it creates automatically. For
example, it created a tag called Office with subfolders for Microsoft
and Apple&#39;s productivity suites. You can rename the tags easily and you
can create your own on the fly. You can choose different icons and
colors to differentiate them. You can also make comments on any app and
the tags and comments are searchable from within the app. Right-clicking
on an item in the Start menu also gives you the option of revealing the
item in the Finder or copying the path to the item.</p>

<p>You can designate any menu item as a favorite and then opt to have the
menu open to those chosen items for quick access. You can also choose to
have it open to any to the other submenus. Other view options include
the ability to change the menu icon and the size of the program
interface. You can assign keyboard shortcuts to any menu or menu item.</p>

<p>Like Folder Peek, you can use Start to browser the folders you include
in the menu choice. You can&#39;t perform any functions on the enclosed
files beyond opening them, getting the path or adding them to your
favorites.</p>

<p>Start is $8.99 <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/start/id1329701389?l=de&amp;ls=1&amp;mt=12">on
the App Store</a>. It is also available through Setapp. </p>
