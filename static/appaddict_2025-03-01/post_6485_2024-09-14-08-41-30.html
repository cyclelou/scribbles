<a href="https://dockey.publicspace.co/">Dockey</a> is an app that controls a few dock preferences: position, show/hide, animation speed, show/hide speed. Some of these choices are available in System settings. Others require you to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-accelerate-dock-macos-terminal/\#:~:text=Accelerating%20the%20Dock%20animation%20speed,%2Dint%200%3Bkillall%20Dock.">run a terminal command</a> unless you use something like Dockey.</li>

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperduck/id6444667067">Hyperduck</a> by indy developer Sindre Sorhus is an app that will let you send links from any app on your phone via the share sheet to the default browser on your Mac. The only thing you have to do on your Mac is open the browser, something that you're going to do anyway. It has one more superpower, the ability to trigger shortcuts on your Mac, initiated from your phone. See <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/automation-april-hyperduck-leverages-the-power-of-url-schemes-to-control-your-mac-from-an-iphone-or-ipad/">this article</a> from the guys at Mac Stories for more info on that.</li>

<a href="https://cleanupbuddy.app/">Cleanup Buddy</a>- Trying to clean the keyboard on my M2 MacBook Air is a pain. With the computer off, touching any key turns it back on. In order to clean the keyboard, I need an app to lock the keys and touchpad and that's where this gem steps in. When I am done cleaning, I just press both command keys at the same time for three seconds and it unlocks the keyboard.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://hyperkey.app/">Hyperkey</a> turns your caps lock key into an extra modifier key my mapping it to a combination of shift+control+option+command, allowing you to create keyboard shortcuts that would be too difficult to make otherwise. You can use apps like Better Touch Tool or Karabiner Elements to make a hyperkey, but this app is probably the simplest way to achieve it. I use multiple hyperkey shortcuts to launch applications.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://unclack.app/\#/">Unclack</a> is an app for all the mechanical keyboard warriors out there who don't want to stand out on Zoom calls anymore. Unclack will mute your microphone when you type so that you don't disturb a meeting or draw attention to yourself while you're taking notes.</li>
