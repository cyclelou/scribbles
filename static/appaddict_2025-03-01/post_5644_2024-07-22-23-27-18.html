<p><br />The macOS finder is a decent enough file manager, but there is a
considerable market for file managers with extra features. I&#39;ve been a
dedicated <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/pathfinder-by-cocoatech">Path
Finder</a> user for a couple of decades, but every once in awhile a like
to try out what else is available from other apps like <a
href="https://binarynights.com/">ForkLift</a>,  <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/commander-one-file-manager/id1035236694?mt=12">Commander
One</a> and most recently <a
href="https://qspace.awehunt.com/en-us/index.html">Qspace</a>,  a
controversial favorite of many Redditors.</p>

<p>Qspace is controversial because it is by a Chinese developer, Tian Wenda
and because it phones home on occasion, ostensibly to ensure licensing
requirements. You can make your determination on your comfort level with
either of those factors. Personally, I&#39;m fine on both counts</p>

<p>There are two different versions of Qspace available, an <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/qspace/id1469774098?mt=12">App Store
version</a> for $12.99 and a version you can download from the <a
href="https://qspace.awehunt.com/en-us/index.html">developer&#39;s
website</a> for $13.99 which comes with a 30-day trial and extra
features like a separate desktop, 100% file manageability, workflow
services and certain terminal services. Both versions have aftermarket
plugins for a file shelf, advanced batch rename, server connections and
enhanced archiver.</p>

<p>Qspace is a full featured and mature application with dozens of features
that you really need to use to understand and I suggest taking advantage
of the 30-day free trial to do so.</p>

<p><strong>My 10 Favorite Features Are:</strong><br />1. There are 12
different multi-pane layouts<br />2. The address bar supports
auto-completion of manually entered file paths<br />3. Quick switching
to Terminal to access the current folder (supports iterm and other
custom Terminal)<br />4. Extremely customizable context menu<br />5.
Custom keyboard shortcuts<br />6. Custom toolbar<br />7. Custom new file
templates<br />8. Full color labels for file names<br />9. Browser
archive contents like browsing a folder<br />10. Stash shelf</p>
