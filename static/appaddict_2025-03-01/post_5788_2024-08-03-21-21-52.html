<p>After reading about NotchNook on Reddit and seeing the 35% off offer
from the $25 purchase price, I purchased it to test it out. I reenabled
the notch on my MacBook, which I had turned off with Better Monitor. The
installation was straightforward, requiring access to the camera,
microphone and Apple Events.</p>

<p>NotchNook has two feature areas, the nook and the file tray. The nook is
where the widgets are located. The currently supported widgets are media
controls, shortcuts, calendar and mirror. There is a placeholder for
notes, but it is not currently active. The media control widget offered
to start Apple Music or YouTube. Once I opened Apple Music, the controls
were no different than what is already available in Control Center with
the exception of being able to use gestures to move between songs. You
can add two shortcuts to the nook, but they do not support drag and drop
nor do they act on files selected in the Finder rendering the usefulness
limited.The calendar displays the current day and two days prior and
after that. There is no way to choose a default calendar and when I
added events to my system default calendar, they did not appear. The
mirror widget displays an image from your built-in camera that is the
literal size of a postage stamp with no way to enlarge it. I did not
find it useful.</p>

<p>The second feature area is the file tray. It serves as a place to drag
and keep files. Once you have a file there, there are no options to
perform other actions, like compression or moving to cloud storage apps
or any kind of image modification actions. It is strictly a holding
area. There is a place holder that states additional file actions are
coming, but as of now, they do not exist.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of depth on the features, I do not recommend
purchasing this app right now. <a

$5.99 app provides a huge variety of file actions. You can use Control
Center for media control and add shortcuts to your dock or menu bar
natively. If you still want to try Notch Nook, you can get it <a

Currently you can get a %35 discount if you tweet about the app.</p>
