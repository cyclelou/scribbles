<p>Back in the days when Apple still made hardware servers and an operating
system to go with them (at $1K a copy) we used to have to deal with
hundreds of user home directories in my line of work as a K-12 system
admin. Most user&#39;s files got deleted at the end of the school year but
some, mostly teachers, got carried over. We would have to back them up
and restore them. Invariably there would be permissions errors for some
people along the way and the utility we turned to time and again was
BatchMod. It&#39;s a GUI for changing permissions on files and folders
(including the files in them). I needed to change some file permissions
this afternoon and when I went to download the app, I found it still
available from third-party sites but the developer is nowhere to be
found and doesn&#39;t appear to be maintaining it any longer.</p>

<p>I downloaded it from another site and tested it on files and folders in
macOS 14.6.1 Sonoma. It was able to change the read, write and execute
for owner, group and everyone on a folder and the enclosed files.
Unfortunately, the feature that would force empty the trash is no longer
functional. Although the download site claims it was last updated in
2023, the actual date on the files is from 2016.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t download this and attempt to use BatchMod on system files. If you
know what you are doing and know how to us chmod (or the Get Info modal
in some cases) to change permissions in case things don&#39;t work out, you
may get some limited use from BatchMod. The last released edition is
1.7b5. I downloaded it at <a
