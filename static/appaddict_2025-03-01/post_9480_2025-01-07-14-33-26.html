<p><br />When I was a younger man, I&#39;ll admit to <a
href="https://louplummer.lol/true-confessions-my-life-on-the-high-seas/">living
the pirate life</a> for music and movies. I was around for the original
Napster and the birth of BitTorrent. That all came to a screeching halt
one weekend when I sat down at my computer and couldn&#39;t connect to the
internet. I called tech support, and the stern-sounding lady on the
phone told me to go to my computer and read what was on the screen. It
basically said, &quot;If I ever download something illegally again, my
Internet will be turned off forever.&quot; There was one checkbox, and it
just said &quot;OK.&quot; I had to check it to get my Internet back. That was the
sudden and dramatic end to my life on the high seas. Since then, I have
resisted using a VPN or other methods of accessing content illegally.
For one thing it adds a lot of friction and for another, in the
streaming age you can get just about anything you want without breaking
the bank.</p>

<p>There are legal torrent sites, most notably <a
href="https://archive.org/">Archive.org</a>. You can find others with a
<a href="https://techuplife.com/best-legal-torrent-sites/">simple
search.</a></p>

<p>A useful automated too to aid in downloading torrents via an RSS feed is
<a href="https://radarr.video/\#home">Radarr</a>. It also works on
Usenet. Radarr&#39;s features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding new movies with a variety of information, such as trailers, ratings, etc.</li>
<li>Support for major platforms: Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, etc.</li>
<li>Can watch for better quality of the movies you have and do an automatic upgrade. <em>eg. from DVD to Blu-Ray</em>
</li>
<li>Automatic failed download handling will try another release if one fails</li>
<li>Manual search so you can pick any release or to see why a release was not downloaded automatically</li>
<li>Automatically searching for releases as well as RSS Sync</li>
<li>Automatically importing downloaded movies</li>
<li>Recognizing Special Editions, Director's Cut, etc.</li>
<li>Identifying releases with hardcoded subs</li>
<li>Identifying releases with AKA movie names</li>
<li>SABnzbd, NZBGet, QBittorrent, Deluge, rTorrent, Transmission, uTorrent, and other download clients are supported and integrated</li>
<li>Full integration with Kodi and Plex (notifications, library updates)</li>
<li>Adding metadata such as posters and information for Kodi and others to use</li>
<li>Advanced customization for profiles, such that Radarr will always download the copy you want</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It takes some time and some skill to get Radarr set up correctly, but
there are <a href="https://radarr.video/\#support">good instructions
provided.</a>. There is also <a
href="https://wiki.servarr.com/radarr">extensive documentation.</a>.</p>
