<p>While trying out a new file manager today, I discovered that Google
Drive had created two copies of itself on my hard drive, including
several folders of files I&#39;d designated to maintain locally. Because of
the mysterious voodoo Apple has cursed cloud storage with, I decided to
use a disk analyzer to see how my disk space was allocated and the tool
I chose was <a href="https://daisydiskapp.com/">Daisy Disk</a>.</p>

<p>Daisy Disk is an app that needs little introduction to seasoned Mac
users. It is a disk space analyzer so well designed that it has won Mac
App Store awards in three different years. For under $10, you get a best
in class utility that&#39;s fast and reliable. If you&#39;ve ever had a case
where seemingly large chucks of your hard drive were showing up as
mysteriously in use, you can use Daisy Disk&#39;s power of scanning as an
administrator to track down the culprit. Daisy Disk scans internal and
external drives whether they are SSD or HDD. It scans local and network
physical and virtual drives. You can also scan cloud storage. Only you
get to decide what to delete, System files are automatically
safeguarded.</p>

<p>Did I mention it&#39;s fast? Other long time Mac disk scanning utilities
like <a href="https://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">Grand
Perspective</a> and <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/more">Omni Disk
Sweeper </a>may be free, but they are slow, very slow. They work OK, but
no one would consider them best in class.</p>

<p>A single license lets you install Daisy Disk on up to five Macs. The
developer offers educational discounts.</p>
