<p>The threat from bad actors who seek to access and exploit user data
increases every year. The list includes for-profit gangs, unscrupulous
developers, the world&#39;s largest social media companies and repressive
governments. The information they could potentially use includes, but
isn&#39;t limited to, financial records, political or social organizing
records, medical records, blackmail material, passwords and personal
communications. Those who seek to access your data have increasingly
sophisticated methods of bypassing weak security.</p>

<p>A small but powerful free and open-source utility, <a
href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt">Picocrypt</a>, weighing in
at only 3MB provides easy to use encryption that is powerful enough to
withstand attacks from government agencies. With Picocrypt&#39;s simple UI,
all you have to do is drag and drop your files, enter a password, and
hit Encrypt. There is no need to set up a volume, as there is with other
tools like Veracrypt.</p>

<p>Installing Picocrypt is simple. Only download Picocrypt <a
href="https://github.com/Picocrypt/Picocrypt/releases/latest/download/Picocrypt.dmg">from
the official site</a>,. Open the container, and drag Picocrypt to your
Applications folder. You may need to manually trust the app from a
terminal and control-click on the app if macOS prevents you from opening
it:</p>

<pre>xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Picocrypt.app</pre>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Uses extra Reed-Solomon parity bytes to protect from file corruption and bit rot</li>
<li>Built in customizable password generator</li>
<li>Comments  to store notes, information, and text along with the encrypted file</li>
<li>Keyfiles, which can be generated and distributed to multiple people if there is joint ownership of information requiring more than one person to authenticate decryption</li>
<li>Paranoid mode - a double encryption method suitable for government level or whistle-blower secrecy</li>
<li>File chunking splits large encrypted files into multiple user selectable sized blocks</li>
<li>Deniability allows encrypted files to appear without identifiable headers so that if they are intercepted, the bad actor in possession of them will have no way to prove what they are. The output volume will indistinguishable from a stream of random bytes, and no one can prove it is a volume without the correct password.</li>
</ul>

<p>Picocrypt also has Windows and Linux versions, meaning that the
recipient of the files does not have to have a Mac to decrypt the files,
just the password. Picocrypt is also portable and does not require
installation. It can be run from an external drive, such as a USB stick.</p>
