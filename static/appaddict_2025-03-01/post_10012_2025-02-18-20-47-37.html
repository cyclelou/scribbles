<p>In the modern era, a time when most people us laptop computers as
opposed to desktops, keeping up with your battery&#39;s remaining charge is
something we&#39;ve trained ourselves to do. There are apps that let you
make extremely detailed plans to carefully manage how your battery
charges. These apps provide a wealth of information about your battery&#39;s
lifespan and electrical data. In normal operation, they keep your
battery from charging past 80% to help prolong its lifespan. They will
also run a calibration cycle to allow your battery to come close to
fully discharging and the fully charging. These practices are reputed to
be necessary to get the longest lifespan for your battery. The two most
widely used apps for this type of management are: <a
href="https://micropixels.software/apps/batfi">BatFi</a> and <a
href="https://apphousekitchen.com/">Al Dente.</a></p>

<p>Not everyone believes these practices are needed or, indeed, are
beneficial. They are satisfied with just monitoring their battery&#39;s
health. A good free app for providing the information you need is
Battery Monitor: Health, Info from Rocky Sand Studio, Ltd. It has a
simple but useful feature set.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Charge percent and time in menu bar</li>
<li>Detailed battery information</li>
<li>Configurable low and full battery alert</li>
<li>Configurable Themes</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get Battery Health Monitor from <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/battery-monitor-health-info/id836505650?mt=12">the
App Store.</a></p>
