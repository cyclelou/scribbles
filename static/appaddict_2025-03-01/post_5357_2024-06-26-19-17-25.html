      <p><a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4">SetApp</a> is a monthly
subscription service that offers access to 240 different Mac apps
starting at $9.99 a month. I currently have 40 different applications
from Setapp installed on my MacBook Air (see the screenshot at the
bottom of this post). Some of them are startup items that run all the
time when my Mac is on. Others I use on a regular basis for maintenance
and routine tasks. They have quite a few apps that I’ve purchased in the
past but no longer have to pay for upgrades because they are now
included in my plan. I’ve listed a dozen of my favorite programs from
Setapp, along with their cost if purchased or subscribed to separately
to give you an idea of what you can save with a subscription. If you use
<a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4">my affiliate link</a>,
you can get 30-days free after a seven-day trial and signing up.</p>

<h2>BetterTouchTool</h2>

<p><a href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a> allows you to
customize various input devices like trackpads, mice, and keyboards. It
offers a wide range of gesture definitions for the Magic Mouse, Macbook
Trackpad and Magic Trackpad, and allows users to trigger keyboard
shortcuts, system actions or custom scripts. Additionally, the app also
features window management and a clipboard manager. My favorite actions
include one click trackpad action to launch a Google search and
launching the <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a> emoji
picker and clipboard manager. ($22 for a lifetime license when purchased
without SetApp)</p>

<h2>CleanMyMacX</h2>

<p><a href="https://macpaw.com/">CleanMyMac X</a> is a versatile
maintenance utility designed to keep your Mac running smoothly. It
includes features for junk file deletion, system optimization,
application updating and uninstalling, plus malware protection. I have a
reminder to run the optimizer once a week. (Yearly subscription price is
$34.95 when purchased without SetApp)</p>

<h2>MindNode</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.mindnode.com/">MindNode</a> is a powerful tool
designed for creating mind maps and visualizing ideas on your Mac. It
has customizable layouts, themes, and easy-to-use drawing tools. I’ve
been using it for over 10 years and took advantage of the SetApp version
to avoid having to pay an upgrade fee. (Yearly subscription $19.99 when
purchased without SetApp)</p>

<h2>24 Hour Wallpaper</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.jetsoncreative.com/24hourwallpaper">24 Hour
Wallpaper</a> app for Mac provides high-quality, time-synchronized
wallpapers that adapt to match local daylight conditions. The wallpapers
change throughout the day, mirroring natural or city scenes suited to
the time. I like it more than the Bing wallpaper app I previously used.
(One-time purchase price is $9.99 without Setapp)</p>

<h2>CloudMounter</h2>

<p><a href="https://cloudmounter.net/">CloudMounter</a> connects your Mac
to cloud storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive. It
mounts these services as local drives, allowing you to manage your
online files directly from Finder. I like it because it let’s me avoid
having to run the native app for each application. (annual license is
$39.99 when purchased without SetApp)</p>

<h2>AlDente Pro</h2>

<p><a href="https://apphousekitchen.com/">AlDente Pro</a> protects your
MacBook battery by intelligently managing its charging behavior. It lets
you set a maximum charge percentage to prolong battery lifespan and
offers various customizable settings for optimal battery health. I keep
my maximum charge set to 70% on my MacBook Air, although I can easily
top it off to 100% if I need to be on battery for a prolonged time. (One
time purchase of $25 without SetApp)</p>

<h2>HoudahSpot</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/?lang=en">HoudahSpot</a>
transforms your Mac’s search capabilities. It builds upon Spotlight,
offering complex search criteria including file attributes, content, and
metadata. I use the saved search functions to find all the Markdown
files created in the last seven days (run as a weekly task) to import my
<a>Obsidian</a> files into <a
href="https://c-command.com/eaglefiler/">EagleFiler</a>. (One-time
purchase price of $39.00 without SetApp)</p>

<h2>PathFinder</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cocoatech.io/">PathFinder</a> is a powerful file
management alternative to macOS Finder. It offers advanced features like
dual-pane browsing, batch renaming, deep folder comparisons, and
customizable interface modules. This is another app I’ve used for more
than a decade. (Annual subscription $29.99 without SetApp)</p>

<h2>Default Folder X</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/">Default Folder
X</a> enhances your Mac’s Open and Save dialog boxes. It offers quick
access to recent folders, favorites, powerful keyboard shortcuts, and
default folder management. I’m a long-time user and no longer have to
pay any upgrade fees. (One-time license costs $34,95 without Setapp)</p>

<h2>Dropzone</h2>

<p><a href="https://aptonic.com/">Dropzone</a> supercharges your Mac’s
productivity with its drag-and-drop interface. It lets you send files to
apps, shorten URLs, execute custom scripts, and much more – all by
simply dragging files or text snippets onto its icon. I use a script to
automatically install apps from DMG files and a shortcut that uploads
media files to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> (License is
$35 without Setapp)</p>

<h2>CleanShot X</h2>

<p><a href="https://cleanshot.com/">CleanShot X</a> elevates screen
capturing on your Mac. It offers far more than basic screenshots with
tools for annotations, blurring, screen recording, and a scrolling
capture mode. CleanShot X delivers professional-looking visuals and
clear communication effortlessly. I’ve used other apps like <a
href="https://shottr.cc/">Shottr</a> and <a
href="https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html">SnagIt</a>) and I
find that CleanShot X offers more. (License is $29 without
SetApp)<action-text-attachment
