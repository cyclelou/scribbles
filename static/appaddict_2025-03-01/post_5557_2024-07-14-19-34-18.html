<p><br />When it comes to text expansion, the apps I use regularly provide
me with a lot of choices.</p>

<h2>Native Expansion</h2>

<p>This isn&#39;t an option for me because it doesn&#39;t have variable support for
things like time and date. Mac text replacement is also not available in
all apps. For example, it is not supported in Microsoft Word, Outlook,
or Firefox. There is also no formatting provided. <a
href="https://vengreso.com/blog/text-replacement-on-mac">More info</a></p>

<h2>Raycast</h2>

<p>I&#39;m a heavy Raycast user, and it is always running on my Mac. The thing
that keeps me from using <a
href="https://manual.raycast.com/snippets">its highly rated snippets
feature</a> is the friction involved in importing my current snippet
collection from the app I use. Raycast snippets are searchable and
suitable for boilerplate text and code. Raycast supports variables.
Alfred, a competing application similar to Raycast, also does text
expansion for those who buy the $40 Powerpack. Of course, as of now,
there is no iOS support.</p>

<h2>Keyboard Maestro</h2>

<p>There&#39;s not much that Keyboard Maestro can&#39;t automate, including text
replacement/expansion. <a
href="https://kau.sh/blog/keyboard-maestro-replace-text-expander/">One
cool feature that Keyboard Maestro has</a> is the ability to add a
microdelay so that in apps like VSCode where replacement works
sporadically because of too quick triggering, you can slow things down
and still get the functionality that you want. You can also kill two
birds with one stone and trigger other macros with your text expansion
snippet. You can do some pretty high-speed expansion with Keyboard
Maestro&#39;s &quot;prompt for user input feature.&quot; No iOS support.</p>

<h2>Better Touch Tool</h2>

<p>As with Keyboard Maestro, <a
href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/bettertouchtool-mac-productivity/">Better
Touch Tool</a> can automate just about anything too, including text
expansion. It&#39;s a bit more rudimentary than other choices but it beats
native expansion by working in all apps.</p>

<h2>Text Expander</h2>

<p>The reality is, I don&#39;t use any of these methods because I have been
using <a href="https://textexpander.com/individual">Text Expander</a>
for over a decade. I have several hundred snippets, and the process of
exporting and importing them into Raycast was too laborious for my
taste. I also, at some point, qualified for a lifetime discount on my
subscription, so it&#39;s fairly cheap. As far as functionality goes, it
does absolutely everything I could ask for in an app of its nature. My
subscription works on Windows and macOS. If you don&#39;t mind another
subscription, it&#39;s a solid choice. There are even libraries of snippets
you can download for things like customer support, coding, and Markdown.
There&#39;s also an iOS version that works through a custom keyboard,
currently in Test Flight.</p>

<h2>Other Solutions</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://espanso.org/">Expanso</a> is a free and open-source text expander that works on macOS, Windows, and Linux (but not iOS). It has many advanced features and would probably be my choice if I wasn't so invested in Text Expander.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ergonis.com/typinator">Typinator</a> is another advanced choice available for a one-time purchase instead of a subscription. Typinator works across all applications and works with names, dates, formulas, variables, images, calculations, code.</li>
</ul>
