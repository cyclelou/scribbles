      <p>I am in the process of moving all my Internet research to <a
href="https://kagi.com">Kagi</a>, but I wrote this for someone who
needed these instructions today.</p>

<p>Google, the advertising company that also has a search engine, is more
interested in having you click on things it gets paid for than it is
showing you the information you are looking for. Of course, it is also
tracking every breath you take in case it figures out how to extract
money from the very air you breathe. There are a couple of steps you can
take to generate more useful information from the company&#39;s search
results.</p>

<h2>Use a Different URL for your searches</h2>

<p>Google is the default search engine in most browsers. It pays billions
of dollars for that privilege on iOS alone - one of the reasons your
choice of search engines is limited on Apple products. Everyone knows
the standard address for a Google search is just <a
href="https://google.com/"><a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a></a>. When you search
there, you get a bunch of useless AI crap and &quot;&quot;suggested links&quot;. If you
want the good old 10 Blue Links of yesteryear,  add “udm=14” to your
default search URL, so it reads as
“<strong><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&amp;udm=14">https://www.google.com/search?q=%s&amp;amp;udm=14</a></strong>” instead
of Google dot com.</p>

<p>To <a
href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95426?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\#:~:text=Manage%20search%20engines%20and%20site%20shortcuts">set
this up in Chrome</a>, go into Settings, then Search engine &gt; Manage
search engines&gt; Site search.</p>

<p>You can also do this in other browsers and in launchers like Raycast for
Mac. Other search utilities like <a
href="https://appaddict.app/post/devonagent-lite-free-tool-to-increase-search-productivity">DevonAgentLite</a>
also support it.</p>

<h2>Filter SEO Churn With Ublacklist</h2>

<p><a
href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe?hl=en">Ublacklist</a>
is an extension that totally blocks certain domains from appearing in
your Google search results. You can also get it for other browsers. Once
you have the extension installed, head over to <a
href="https://codeberg.org/bbbhltz/16CompaniesFilters">this Codeberg
page</a> to subscribe to lists of sites to exclude from your search
results. These lists were inspired by the article <a
href="https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/">How Google is
killing independent sites like ours</a> on HouseFresh and <a
href="https://detailed.com/google-control/">Detailed.com&#39;s <em>How 16
Companies are Dominating the World’s Google Search Results</em></a>.</p>

<p>There are more specialized but still helpful lists at <a
