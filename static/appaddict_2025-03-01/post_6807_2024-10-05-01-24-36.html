<p><br />I recently saw an announcement for the release of version 3.0 of
the Internet history and bookmarking tool <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/surfed-history-bookmark/id1591590700">Surfed</a>.
Previous app store reviews of the app stated that it had a lot of
potential but that it wasn&#39;t a mature product. I had hopes that a new
version would correct that.</p>

<p>I downloaded the app and purchased the pro version. I was disappointed
to find out that the iOS version only works with Safari as I am an Edge
user. After downloading the browser extensions needed for the app to
work I opened a new tab in my browser to find that Surfed had taken over
that feature and that if I disabled it, Surfed would not work.</p>

<p>One of the primary features of Surfed is recording your browsing
history. It does this on a joint and per device basis. I have a desktop,
a laptop, an iPad and an iPhone. Surfed consistently creates duplicate
copies of both my computers causing me to constantly merge the browsing
history of the copies with a master record and then delete the extras.
Surfed also randomly stops or fails to record my browsing history for
hours at the time.</p>

<p>After the 3.1 update, the new page browser feature is no longer working
as it was before. I use my new browser page to hold shortcuts to
frequently opened web pages and not having the ability to access those
is a serious impediment to my workflow.</p>

<p>I imported about 1000 favorites from Raindrop.io into Surfed. The
bookmarks are organized by the tags I had assigned in Raindrop and the
tags in Surfed are case sensitive, which means that for many categories,
I have for example, a #Blogging and a #blogging collection. There is no
way to drag and drop multiple bookmarks onto the correct tag, nor is
there a way to rename tags to merge them, making it necessary to retag
the bookmarks one at the time. There is a workaround available that
involves making a tag group I eventually discovered but the process was
not intuitive and featured disappearing and reappearing tags. It was
very confusing.</p>

<p>I plan to spend more time with Surfed to try and figure out how its
logic works and to troubleshoot the reasons why it stops recording web
history and why the browser page isn&#39;t functioning properly. One of the
things I discovered today was that the sync function has to be run
manually from the menu Like previous reviewers have noted, the app has a
lot of potential, but it is still not mature enough to recommend.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://surfed.app/">developers website</a> explains some
more of the claimed functionality of the program.</p>
