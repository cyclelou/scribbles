<p><br /><a
href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/download-your-kindle-books-right-now-amazon-is-killing-this-option-in-a-few-days/">Amazon
recently announced</a> its intention to prevent customers from being
able to download copies of their purchased ebooks, a feature it had
supported since the inception of the Kindle. Amazon is also the company
behind Audible, the popular vendor of audiobooks. Although they have not
said they will be revoking download access to this service, it is a
possibility and audiobook owners looking for a way to back up what they
have purchased are looking for a solution to make this content useful
outside the Amazon walled garden.</p>

<p>The solution I am using is <a
href="https://getlibation.com">Libation</a>, a FOSS title available on
GitHub. Libation is a bare-bones application without a fancy UI, but it
is fully functional and takes only a few minutes to set up and use.
After it converted my audiobooks into M4B files, a standard audiobook
format which allows bookmarks, I was able to play my books using VLC and
various iOS apps like the free <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audiobooks-mp3-m4b-player/id6471399965">Audiobooks
MP3 and M4B Player</a>.</p>

<p>One warning - the file sizes are large. If you have a sizable
collection, I would advise against downloading to your internal hard
drive unless you have a lot of free space. Saving to an external drive
would be a better option.</p>
