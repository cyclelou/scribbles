<p><br />If you want to download video from YouTube, there are a variety of
ways. There is a <a
href="https://www.raycast.com/vimtor/youtube-downloader">Raycast
Extension.</a> There is the great free YouTube muti-action app, <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/freetube-maybe-the-most-underrated-app">Freetube</a>.
For CLI folks, there is <a
href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a>.  Finally there is
Downie from Charlie Monroe. Downie not only downloads from YouTube,
Youku, Bilibili and Vimeo it can download from more than 1,000 sites
with more being added bi-weekly. You can even write to the developer and
request that a site be added and chances are he will act on it. He even
offers to help if you run into a problematic video on a site already in
the supported list.</p>

<p>Downie can download 4K video, which not all downloaders can do. It can
also convert to MP-4 (for iPad and iPhone use) or do only audio
extraction on the fly. It supports iCloud synchronization to maintain
your download history over different devices. The app has muli-language
support and the developer offers free licenses to anyone who adds a new
language to the support library. If you have a legacy operating system,
past versions of Downie can be downloaded.</p>

<p>Downie is a one-time purchase of $19.99 from <a
href="https://software.charliemonroe.net/downie/">the developer&#39;s
website</a> and a single license is good for all the computers you
personally own, although if that is greater than three you need to
contact the dev for an accommodation. <a
href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/kmjmclw4">Downie is also available on
Setapp.</a></p>

<p>There was a minor controversy some time back when the developer left
empty threats in his code to delete files from the computers of those
running pirated versions of the software. He has since apologized for
doing that and no files were actually deleted from anyone&#39;s machine. </p>
