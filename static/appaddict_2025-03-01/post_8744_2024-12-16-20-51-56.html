<p><br />One big feature missing from Apple&#39;s new Passwords App is secure
notes to store data besides passwords. While you can make notes within
the app, it isn&#39;t designed to store that kind of info. You could opt for
the Apple Notes app since it&#39;s secured by the same security and allows
you to password protect individual items with a password. It even
supports templates, but you would have to build them yourself. If you
want a secure, ready-made solution you can use on iOS and macOS, <a
href="https://access.foyerobjet.com/">Access</a> may be right for you.</p>

<p>Access has templates for the following kinds of data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Payment card</li>
<li>Bank account</li>
<li>ID</li>
<li>Document</li>
<li>Driver's License</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Medical Record</li>
<li>Rewards program</li>
<li>Membership</li>
<li>Software license</li>
<li>Gift card</li>
<li>API keys</li>
<li>Secure personal entries (address book format)</li>
<li>Notes (useful for all those 2FA code backups)</li>
</ul>

<p>Every entry has room for user-defined custom fields and attachments, so
not only can you have easy to copy info from your important documents,
you can also have a photographic copy of them as well.</p>

<p>The layout and appearance of Access is identical to that of the
Passwords app. Since privacy is paramount considering the types of data
stored in Access, the developer goes into great detail to explain it
&quot;Your information is backed up and kept up-to-date across your devices
via iCloud. Access is using Apple’s industry-leading iCloud Encryption
to protect your information. No data is ever sent to any server other
than iCloud. The app doesn&#39;t create, access, or store keys for any
encrypted data. With Advanced Data Protection for iCloud, all Secure
Data stored in Access is end-to-end encrypted and is inaccessible to the
Developer, Apple, or any third party at all times. For an added layer of
security, Access supports authentication with Touch ID. All data stored
in Access on your device is automatically encrypted and decrypted by the
system.&quot;</p>

<p>Access has a free version with limited functionality, but to get access
to every feature, you&#39;ll need to <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/access-passwords-companion/id6469049274">purchase
lifetime access</a> for $29.99 or subscribe for $9.99 yr/$3.99 mo.</p>
