<p>There are certain apps that really should be incorporated into the
operating system. One of those is Shareful by Sindre Sorhus. The share
menu on the Mac seems like an afterthought when compared to the
comparable menu in iOS. Many developers fail to implement the feature in
their apps, and Apple itself leaves it purposefully underpowered for
some reason. Thankfully, Shareful exists with three supremely useful
functions.</p>

<h2>Copy</h2>

<p>Copy the shared item to the clipboard and so you can quickly paste it
into another app. This is my most frequent use case. I have a number of
Apple shortcuts that have text output. I use Shareful to copy that
output to use in other places. Without Shareful, I&#39;d have to use the
text to create a file, then open the file and copy from there. Another
useful option is to use this app to copy a screenshot to the clipboard
through the share menu.</p>

<h2>Save As</h2>

<p>Choose a directory to save the shared item to.</p>

<h2>Open In</h2>

<p>Open the shared item in any app. You can open the current Safari URL in
a different browser. In Safari, click the share button, select &quot;Open
In…&quot;, and then select a browser. There is a Raycast extension that also
does this if you are a Raycast user.</p>

<p><strong>Frequent use cases:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In Photos, use the “Open In” share service to open one or more photos directly in Photoshop.</li>
<li>Quickly copy content from an app that doesn't normally support copying.</li>
<li>In Safari, right-click an image, and use the “Open In” share service to open it directly in another app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Shareful is available on the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shareful/id1522267256?mt=12">Mac App
Store.</a> If you do not have access to the App Store, you can download
a version from <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/shareful">the
developer&#39;s website</a>, although it is not updated as often.</p>
