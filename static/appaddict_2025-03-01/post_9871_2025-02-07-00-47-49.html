<p>I switched to using Vivaldi late last year after being all in on
Microsoft Edge because of work. I am trying to leave as many big tech
companies behind as possible, and I grew tired of having AI shoved in my
face all day. Vivaldi is a Chromium-based browser designed for the
technically proficient, who form the core of its 3.1 million user base.</p>

<p>Through the years I&#39;ve used Netscape, Internet Explorer, Camino, Safari,
Chrome and Edge. None of them ever provided the customization options
that Vivaldi does. The ability to group tabs and save them as browsing
sessions is a real game changer. The iOS version is great too and
getting to my bookmarks, tabs and history works well between platforms.
<a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/vivaldi-on-desktop-7-1/">Version 7.1
was released recently</a> and these are some of the new features.</p>

<h2>Bring Your Tabs Along</h2>

<p>If the thought of abandoning the open tabs in your current browser gives
you anxiety, Vivaldi now has you covered. It can import them all so you
can get right back to doing what you were doing without having to set
things up again.</p>

<h2>Speed Dials</h2>

<p>Vivaldi has a mechanism for setting up link collections called Speed
Dials. You can reach your Speed Dials right from the new tab page. I
have several, including one with the websites I use for posting to my
blog and another for research. The process for adding sites to them has
been redesigned and is no easier than ever to manage.</p>

<h2>Seamless Tab Sharing</h2>

<p>If, like me, you use your browser on multiple devices, four in my case,
the ability to send tabs to my phone, iPad or work computer is easier
than ever. I can continue to read or research anything without using
third-party software or cumbersome workarounds.</p>

<h2>New Default Search Engines</h2>

<p>Vivaldi doesn’t track you, profile you, or sell your data. It&#39;s
monetized by defaulting to one of three search engines, although you are
free to use anything you want. Vivaldi features Startpage, Ecosia,
DuckDuckGo and Qwant. It&#39;s built in tracker blocking and the
availability of ad blockers routinely give me a score of 99 to 100 on
sites that grade privacy.</p>

<h2>Weather Widget</h2>

<p>There is a new custom weather widget for Vivaldi&#39;s new tab page, which
it calls a dashboard. The dashboard already has widgets to display your
email inbox, top stories from your choice of RSS feeds, your calendar
and more.</p>

<h2>Dashboard Customization</h2>

<p>You can now customize the look of your dashboard with themes ranging
from minimalist styles to bold and colorful. The page background is
adjustable to fit your style, and you can color your widgets to match
the overall them you&#39;ve chosen for the browser as a whole.</p>
