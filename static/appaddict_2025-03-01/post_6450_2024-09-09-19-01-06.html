<p>In today&#39;s connected environment notifications can be vital or they can
be an unwelcome hinderance. It&#39;s different for each individual.
Personally, I don&#39;t get so many that it interferes with my work, and I
prefer to find out someone is attempting to contact me as soon as
possible. I operate my Macs with the dock hidden, so relying on
notifications there isn&#39;t useful to me. <a
href="https://badgeify.app">Badgeify</a>, a freemium app from Techflow
Studio Limited provides a menu bar-based notification system I find
useful. Any app that uses the Mac notification system can be added to
Badgeify. In my own use case, I chose five apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apple Messages</li>
<li>Facebook Messenger</li>
<li>Microsoft Teams</li>
<li>Microsoft Outlook (with three email accounts)</li>
<li>Discord</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose how the icons are displayed in the menu bar, always
shown, transparent when inactive or hidden when inactive. You can also
choose to have the icons hidden unless there is a notification, which is
what I went with. Clicking on an icon switches to or launches the app.
Only active apps display notifications.</p>

<p>I was satisfied with the default application icons, which display in
color. but if matching aesthetics are important to you, you can choose
custom monochrome menu bar icons.</p>

<p>Badgeify is free for up to three apps with limited choices on icon
display. A single computer license is $19 and a two-computer license is
$29. Both of these options feature unlimited apps and your choice of
icon display options. It is fully compatible with menu bar management
apps like Bartender, Ice and Hidden Bar. Badgeify is compatible with
macOS 10.15 Catalina and all later versions.</p>

<p>Badgeify is based on <a

available on GitHub.</p>
