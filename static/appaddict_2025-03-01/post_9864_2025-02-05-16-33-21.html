<p><br />Announced a year ago on Kickstarter, Tapestry by Iconfactory was
released on February 4. Tapestry is an aggregator that creates a
combined timeline from a long list of possible sources including :</p>

<ul>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>YouTube channels</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Mastodon</li>
<li>Bluesky</li>
<li>Micro.blog</li>
<li>Tumblr</li>
<li>Reddit</li>
</ul>

<p>Items in your timeline are shown in chronological order. There is no
algorithm. Searching within Tapestry searches across all feeds.
Likewise, setting a mute filter for terms such as &quot;Elon Musk&quot; will block
content from every source. Content from different sources is color coded
to make readily apparent which resource your information is coming from.
If you install Tapestry on a phone and an iPad, your reading position
syncs across devices via iCloud. You can combine sources in any way you
want to have your own custom feeds. I am still experimenting, but so far
I created the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal bloggers</li>
<li>Hard news</li>
<li>Tech news</li>
<li>Combined Mastodon and Bluesky home feeds</li>
<li>Favorite individual social media feeds, since you can add a feed for a single account holder (e.g. Kottke, AOC, Joan Westenberg)</li>
</ul>

<p>The settings allow you to choose an icon, a theme and a font for the
timeline. You can use the in app browser or your default browser to view
content. I recommend doing that so you can view content using reader
mode. Reddit links open in the Reddit app. Mastodon links open in my
browser, although I can use the share sheet to open them in my preferred
app. Tapestry also has bookmarks.</p>

<p><br />The privacy policy states that all searches take place on your
device. The developers do not collect any data.</p>

<p>Iconfactory offers monthly subscriptions for $1.99, yearly for $19.99
and a one time purchase for $79.99. A Mac version is in the works, but
is not here yet. There is a free version with limited features. Get it
on <a

App Store</a></p>
