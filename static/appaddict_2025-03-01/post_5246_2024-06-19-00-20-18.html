<p>For the past six weeks I&#39;ve averaged about 16-17 posts a week on three
different blogs. I&#39;ve also been sharing a photo every day on Micro.blog
from a project I did a while back called <a
href="https://amerpie.lol/photos/">100 Strangers</a>. I just started a
links blog that I will try to post to every day. I usually write my
posts a day ahead of time. I start writing in Obsidian, using Markdown
if my post is going on <a href="http://amerpie.lol">Micro.blog</a>, <a
href="https://amerpie.omg.lol/">OMG.LOL</a> or<a
href="https://linkage.lol"> BearBlog</a>. If it&#39;s a post going on <a
href="https://louplummer.lol">Scribbles</a>, then I still use Obsidian,
but I leave it as plain text.</p>

<p>Very occasionally I will paste the content into iA writer or use the
editing function of the Text Generator plugin in Obsidian to get a
grammar and content check. When I first started blogging, I used the
online word processor at <a href="https://lex.page/~">Lex.page</a> a few
times but that is more friction than I want to deal with. Most of the
time though, I just paste the content right into the web interface on
Microsoft Edge, <a
href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/01/09/microsoft-edge-really.html">my
choice of browser</a> and use the built in spell and punctuation checks.</p>

<p>A lot of times, I&#39;ll start writing at work on my lunch hour or break and
pick it back up at home, relying on Obsidian sync to make the file
available in both places. After <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/historyhound-a-must-have-research-tool-1">writing
an app review yesterday</a> about an app I&#39;d <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/historyhound-a-must-have-research-tool">already
written about in April</a>, I have now started a spreadsheet to keep
track of what I&#39;ve written about so that doesn&#39;t happen again.</p>

<p>I do not have a file of ideas or prompts or drafts for any of my online
endeavors. For app reviews, I literally look in my Applications folder
for ideas. I have over 400 apps installed, so I have a lot to choose
from. For <a href="https://obsidian.amerpie.lol">my tech blog</a>, where
I only write long form posts a couple of times a week, I just have to
pick up ideas from reading or online forums. For my personal blog, just
start brainstorming in the morning until an idea occurs to me.</p>

<p>Every platform I use allows you to schedule posts ahead of time and I
use that feature each night to schedule everything for the next morning.
I get up at 4:30am and by that time the folks in Europe are already
awake and online. By 8am, everything I&#39;ve written the previous day is
posted and the whole process starts over.</p>
