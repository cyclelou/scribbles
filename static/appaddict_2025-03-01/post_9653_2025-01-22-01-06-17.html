<p><strong>A Python script that will count the words in a folder of
markdown files. #Obsidian #ObsidianMD #PKM</strong></p>

<p>I use Obsidian to write a minimum of three blog posts every day as well
as technical documents for my job.  Of course, I also compose and edit
notes in it too. At the end of 2024, I was curious to see how many words
I&#39;d written on each blog during the year. Unfortunately, I could not
find a plugin that could do this, but I suspected that Python probably
could. After working on it for a while with the help of Google Gemini, I
had an easy to run script that would work on any folder in my vault.  If
you have any Python experience, you won&#39;t find this difficult at all to
use. The only edit you need to make is for the path of the folder you
want to evaluate. Just save this in a text editor like BBEdit with a .py
extension. Change the permissions on it using chmod and it will be ready
to run.</p>

<pre>chmod +x pythonScript.py </pre>

<p>NOTE: A kind person on Reddit pointed me toward a plugin that has this
functionality if you&#39;d rather go that route. It is called <a
href="https://github.com/isaaclyman/novel-word-count-obsidian">Novel
Word Count.</a></p>

<h2>The Script</h2>

<pre>\#!/usr/bin/env python3
import os

def count_words_in_markdown(filepath):
  """Counts the number of words in a markdown file.

  Args:
    filepath: Path to the markdown file.

  Returns:
    The number of words in the file.
  """
  with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()
  \# Simple word counting by splitting on whitespace
  words = content.split()
  return len(words)

def count_words_in_directory(directory):
  """Counts the total number of words in all markdown files within a directory.

  Args:
    directory: Path to the directory containing markdown files.

  Returns:
    The total word count across all markdown files.
  """
  total_words = 0
  for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    if filename.endswith(".md"):
      filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
      total_words += count_words_in_markdown(filepath)
  return total_words

if __name__ == "__main__":
  directory_to_search = "PUT THE PATH TO A FOLDER HERE"  \# Replace with your directory
  total_word_count = count_words_in_directory(directory_to_search)
  print(f"Total words in markdown files: {total_word_count}")</pre>
