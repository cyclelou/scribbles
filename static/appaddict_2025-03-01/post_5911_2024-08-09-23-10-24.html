<p><a href="https://usetype.app/">Type</a> is a menu bar app designed with
one purpose in mind, to capture time-stamped notes in plain text or
Markdown format quickly and to get out of your way. It&#39;s fast and more
versatile than using the fn+Q Apple Quick Note feature which doesn&#39;t
time stamp and is available only in Apple Notes which isn&#39;t universally
used. I set my shortcut keys to ^+, (control+comma) and I saved my
default note as a .md file in my Obsidian vault. Now I have a super
quick way to add lines to the note throughout the day. Obsidian doesn&#39;t
even have to be open to add to your note, but if it is closed and you
want to open it, you can do so from within Type.</p>

<p>You can have more than one active note at the time. The interface allows
you to use the mouse or arrow keys to switch between them.You can create
a new note at any time. The preferences are pretty utilitarian. You can
set you shortcut key, choose to have the app open at login
(recommended), choose to have a menu bar icon and select an app to open
your notes, as mentioned, that is Obsidian in my case.</p>

<p>You can also set your formatting options for the date and time and
choose whether you want new notes to appear at the top or the bottom of
documents.</p>

<p>Type comes with a one-week free trial before reverting to read only
mode. It is a $4.99 one-time purchase in the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quick-note-taking-type/id1664249924?mt=12">Mac
App Store</a>. </p>
