      <p>Unlike Windows.macOS does not have a built in uninstall utility.
Occasionally some complex apps might come with a built-in uninstaller,
but for the most part, you are on your own. It used to be that you could
just delete the application from the Finder and be done with it, but as
applications have grown in size and complexity, their support files have
grown too and your ~/Library and ~/Library/Application support folder
may have many files with sizes into the gigabytes that need to be
deleted along with their apps. Luckily for Mac users there are two
excellent free uninstall applications to choose from.</p>

<p>App Cleaner from FreeMacSoftware is the more bare bones app of the two.
Its user interface is a simple window where you drag and drop an
application you want to uninstall. App Cleaner quickly analyzes the app,
identifies its supporting files and lists them giving you the
opportunity to deselect anything you might want to keep (like a plist
file in case you want to save your preferences to reinstall the app
later). Then you click a button, authenticate and the process is quickly
over. App Cleaner&#39;s secret super power is Smart Delete. SmartDelete
detects when apps are trashed manually or by other programs and will
automatically find and offer to remove related files. In the security
and privacy settings, App Cleaner required full disk access.</p>

<p>The app can be downloaded from <a
href="https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/">the developer&#39;s web
site</a>.  It was last updated in July of 2023.</p>

<p><br />Pear Cleaner, by Indy Developer Alin Lupascuhas, has a more
detailed user interface. It lists all of the applications installed on
your computer alphabetically or by size and gives you their file size.
If you click on an app, it gives you more information such as the
required processor type. Like App Cleaner, it also lists all the
individual files and folders it identifies for deletion and gives you a
chance to deselect any of the before clicking the uninstall button. It
identifies any progressive web apps you may have installed as well as
any iOS apps running on your silicon Mac. Pear Cleaner can scan your
computer for leftover files from old uninstalls. In my case, it was
unable to find any, probably because I have practiced good computer
hygiene since I got the machine.</p>

<p>Pear Cleaner has some extra features. It can identify when a file was
installed via Homebrew and update your Homebrew files upon
uninstallation. It also has a Finder extension to allow you to uninstall
applications right from the finder even if Pear Cleaner is closed. like
App Cleaner, it has a feature, it calls Sentinel Monitor, to remove
leftover files immediately if an app is trashed manually. Pear Cleaner
requires full disk access, accessibility access and automation
permission. You can skin the app and choose whether to have it from from
the dock, menu bar or both. The app is updated often, almost too often,
as I get tired of continuously downloading new versions manually, the
only update method.</p>

<p>It can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/alienator88">from the
developer&#39;s GutHub</a> page.</p>

<h2>My choice</h2>

<p>I use App Cleaner. In testing, it consistently identified files and
folders missed by Pear Cleaner and the feature that is most important to
me is complete uninstallation. Although it does not have a Finder
Extension, you can still right-click on applications and choose Open
With &gt; App Cleaner to open it and uninstall an application.</p>
