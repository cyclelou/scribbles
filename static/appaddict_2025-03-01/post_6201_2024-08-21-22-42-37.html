<p>The native Mac tools are great but most of them can be replaced with
third-party apps that add extra features. Even the geeky apps like
Terminal and Activity Monitor have apps like iTerm and Smotrite to serve
as alternatives. There is one app though that I think is perfect the way
Apple designed it. Every time I use it, I am amazed at how well it
works. That app is <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102613">Migration Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>Last year I bought an M2 MBA to replace a 2020 Intel MBP. I had hundreds
of apps and cloud storage from iCloud, Google Drive and Dropbox. I had
countless tweaks and automations tied into the system through apps like
<a href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/01/my-top-keyboard.html">Keyboard
Maestro</a>, <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macapps/comments/1c65hxv/apple_magic_trackpad_and_better_touch_tool_what/">Better
Touch Tool</a>, <a
href="https://amerpie.lol/2024/05/10/my-favorite-actions.html">Hazel</a>
and <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/karabiner-elements-to-the-rescue">Karabiner
Elements</a>. Many of the apps I had installed were licensed apps
purchased directly from developers, not from the MAS. As a long time Mac
user, I had a large iPhoto library, wallpaper collection and personal
files going all the way back to the mid-90s. Then there were a few dozen
wireless networks to which I&#39;d authenticated and the settings for my
VPN.</p>

<p>I brought home the new Mac, turned it on and when prompted by Migration
Assistant,  I plugged in my Time Machine backup and selected from a menu
what I wanted to restore: two user accounts, Applications, other files
and folders and the system. I kicked off the restore process and figured
it would take hours. It took 20 minutes. It was so fast that I thought
something was wrong. When I logged in to the new machine, I had to
approve a ton of security requests from the apps in my login settings, a
one-time hassle. The rest of the process was painless. My apps were
there, properly registered and licensed. My keyboard shortcuts and
automations worked. There was very little fiddling to do.</p>

<p>Four months later, I bought an iMac for work and repeated the process. I
got the same result. Migration Assistant is such a great app. You can
run it at any time. If your partner&#39;s computer dies and all you have is
a Time Machine backup, you can use Migration Assistant to import their
account, apps and settings to your Mac. You can also use Migration
Assistant straight from another computer on the same Network or
connected physically with a USB cable. Products that try to do this in
the Windows world are expensive and they don&#39;t work anywhere as
seamlessly as Migration Assistant does. <br /><action-text-attachment

<p>Copying the information from one Mac to another is painless. Some people
would rather always do a clean install because they feel like that&#39;s the
only way to clear the cruft from their setup. More power to them. You
can avoid having a messy Library folder by using an uninstaller like <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/app-cleaner-vs-pear-cleaner">App
Cleaner</a> from day one and by doing periodic maintenance on your
machine. I&#39;ve used Migration Assistant in an unbroken chain since at
least Mavericks with no ill effects.  </p>
