<p><br />If you&#39;ve been online for a long time, you very well may have
accounts on dozens of services, including social media platforms.
Despite your best attempts at privacy, there may well be old posts
floating around that you wouldn&#39;t want associated with you currently.
People change over time, and comments that seemed clever when you were a
teenager may seem pretty cringe today. There are services out there that
offer to clean all that up for you, but they are expensive and require
that you turn your credentials over to a third party. Luckily, there is
a universal Mac app that can do total or selective removal of your
content from 30+ different apps, websites and services. It&#39;s called <a
href="https://redact.dev/">Redact Privacy</a>. It removes posts, DMs,
photos, videos, likes, and other unique content on various social
networks. You can delete by keyword, sentiment, content type, and more.</p>

<h2>
<br />It has a free tier that will :</h2>

<ul>
<li>Delete unlimited tweets, retweets, and likes from Twitter/X</li>
<li>Anonymize unlimited Reddit posts and comments</li>
<li>Delete up to 30 days of content on Discord &amp; Facebook</li>
</ul>

<p>To access the other services requires a subscription, but paying for a
single month for $7.99 should give you adequate time to clean up your
posts. Subscribing lets you take advantage of scheduled deletions if for
some reason you need that. The app is available on the <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/redact-privacy/id6449900531">Mac App
Store</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>
