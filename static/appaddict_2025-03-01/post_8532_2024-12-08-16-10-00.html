<p><br /><a href="https://simplenote.com">Simplenote</a> by Automattic is a
free cross-platform plain text / Markdown notes app for macOS, iOS,
Android, Windows and Linux. It&#39;s been around for over a decade and I
have never known it to go down. Automattic is the company behind Word
Press and Day One, so it&#39;s no fly-by-night enterprise. </p>

<p>One of the primary benefits of using Simplenote is the speed. It syncs
behind the scenes and opens quickly, regardless of platform. Each note
has a history, and you can view changes you&#39;ve made to it over time.
Notes are easy to share on a Mac using the system share sheet. If you
don&#39;t have access to a device on which you have Simplenote installed,
you can get to your notes in a browser. </p>

<p>Notes in Simplenote are organized by tags. Use as many as you want. You
can also do simple searches of your notes via text strings. Simplenote
is compatible with Apple&#39;s new writing tools, which means you have
access to dictation, proofreading, rewriting, spelling and grammar
correction. Information about each note, including creation date,
modification date, character count and word count is available at the
click of a button. Like most modern apps, Simplenote has a light and
dark mode. You can also control the default text size. Important notes
can be pinned to the top of your notes list. </p>

<p>The Simplenote API is open to developers. There are several other
note-taking apps on various platforms that can access your notes
database. On such app is <a
