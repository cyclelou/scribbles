<p>For years, <a href="https://macbartender.com/">Bartender</a> was one of
the most highly recommended utility apps in the Mac space. There were
many highly complementary recommended reviews in the tech press and from
satisfied users. All of that came crashing to a halt in 2024 when the
original developer cashed out and sold the app to new owners without
anyone immediately disclosing the sale. Because menu mar managers like
Bartender require screen recording permissions, security minded users
were justifiably alarmed but the tin foil hat brigade lost their minds.
All kinds of nefarious plots and schemes were pitched (the commies,
spyware, price increases, subscriptions and more). Some people even
accused the new owners of counterfeiting messages from the original dev.
Telemetry was briefly introduced and then removed, sparking more
tin-foil hattery. </p>

<p>Outside of the Reddit and perpetually online bubble, Bartender remained
popular. On Setapp, the subscription app service with 1 million users,
it is the number one most downloaded app. The reason for this is simple.
Bartender is great, and it has been through several versions. I&#39;ve used
it non-stop for over a decade. I have over 40 menu bar apps running most
of the time and it manages them without a hitch. The program is under
active development and even more features are on the way.</p>

<h2>What Makes Bartender So Good</h2>

<p>Like other menu bar managers, Bartender allows you to select what is
visible on your screen during normal operations. With a click on the
Bartender menu, you can see a secondary display of icons, called the
Bartender bar, which can also be summoned through a variety of user
defined actions. You can also specify that certain icons never appear in
either the menu bar or the Bartender bar.</p>

<p>Bartender allows you to make a number of aesthetic changes to the
appearance of the menu bar, including borders, colors and corners.</p>

<p>You can create multiple presets containing different configuration of
icons if you want to show and hide icons depending on your workflow. Any
of those presets can contain groups of icons, basically a submenu. I
group all of my cloud services into one of these.</p>

<p>Bartender can automatically load a preset using triggers. The current
triggers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Battery - trigger when on battery power or charging, or at a specific level.</li>
<li>WiFi - trigger when connected/not connected to a WiFi network. Or when connected to a specific network</li>
<li>Location - trigger when at a specific location.</li>
<li>Time/Date - schedule when to trigger</li>
<li>Icon Appearance - useful for icons like VPNs that change appearance when connected</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose icon spacing using three categories: normal spacing,
small spacing, no spacing.</p>

<p>There is a search feature that lets you bring any of your menu bar icons
into view. You can open it from the Bartender menu or from a hotkey.</p>

<p>If you would like to test Bartender, you can get a four week free trial
at <a href="https://macbartender.com/">the app&#39;s website</a>.</p>
