<p>I have used various location tracking apps over the years. Most of the
ones I&#39;ve tried have had issues. Either the company behind them folded
or the apps had poor privacy policies or were strictly for iOS and
drained my battery faster than I liked. These apps are often
subscription-based. Google will gladly track your location for free
using your device if you let them, but what sane person wants Google of
all companies knowing their every move?</p>

<p>The one app that consistently delivers added features, accuracy, and
unsurpassed privacy is <a href="https://www.geofency.com/">Geofency</a>
by developer <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/karl-heinz-herbel/id891641490">Karl
Heinz Herbel</a>. It is a universal app for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch
and Mac. I use my iPhone as the default for tracking my location and use
the Mac version to pull reports and see my data. Geofency is currently
at version 9 and has been in the app store for 12 years. Geofency does
not do route tracking, so look elsewhere if that&#39;s what you need.
Instead, it tracks the amount of time you spend at the locations you
visit. I used it for years when I worked in a rural county, traveling
between schools. When I needed to complete my expense report, I could
pull all my data from Geofency as well as for my time card. If, for some
reason, it fails to accurately record a visit (rarely) you can manually
edit the data.</p>

<p>It is accurate enough that today I use it to determine which buildings
on the campus of the university where I work I have visited during the
current reporting period. I am able to add notes to any visit to a
particular building for later reference. For visits to commercial
locations, Geofency connects to Apple Maps to pull phone, address and
website data. I can automatically export visits to any location to any
calendar. The app will even generate a CSV time sheet for any time
period I specify for any location. I can customize the locations by
renaming them or resizing the spatial radius Geofency recognizes,
helpful for separate locations near one another.</p>

<p>None of your Geofency data is collected by the developer. It all lives
in your iCloud account only.</p>

<p>The iOS app features live activities and widgets. I would gladly pay a
higher price for this app I have now used for over a decade, but it is
still only $4.99 as a one-time purchase in. the <a

Store.</a></p>
