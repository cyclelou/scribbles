<p></action-text-attachment><br />There&#39;s something to be said for apps
that do one thing well. Here are a few that I&#39;ve found lately.</p>

<p><a href="https://fnable.com/en/">FNable</a> - If you use your function
keys much, you may grow tired of having to toggle them with the FN key.
Be default, macOS treats function keys as system controls. This little
app allows you to toggle the behavior simply be pressing and holding the
FN key for three seconds. You definitely want to find this app on sale
though. It is regularly priced at a whopping $25 . It is currently
available at <a
href="https://bundlehunt.com/bundle/2024-blackfriday-macos-bundle">Bundlehunt</a>
for $1.50.</p>

<p><a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quill-notes-app/id6496970950?mt=12">Quill</a>
- Quill is a menu bar notes app similar to <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scrap-paper">Scrap Paper</a>and
<a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/scratchpad-floating-notes-but-better">Scratchpad</a>
with one big difference, you can use images in Quill notes. The notes
sync across Macs, but there isn&#39;t an iOS app. You can, however, export
your Quill notes easily enough if you want to view them on your phone.
It is $.99 in the App Store.</p>

<p><a href="https://trace-app.pages.dev/">Trace</a> - Trace is a minimalist
time tracking app. When you manually start a session of, it records the
apps you work on and the time you spend in them. You can pause and
resume sessions. It reports the amount of time you spend in each app and
other facts, like your most used app. It is a free app. For more
detailed automatic reports, try <a
href="https://apps.louplummer.lol/post/activity-watch-free-no-effort-time-tracker">Activity
Watch,</a> also free.</p>

<p><a href="https://spacesaver.gurubag.com/">SpaceSaver</a> - With
SpaceSaver, you can save the state of your open applications and
windows, and easily restore them later. You can have multiple sessions
and switch between them with ease. It doesn&#39;t have the prettiest
interface but what it lacks in aesthetics, it makes up for in function
and price - free!</p>
