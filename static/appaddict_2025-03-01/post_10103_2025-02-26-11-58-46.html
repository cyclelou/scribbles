<p><br />Developer, writer and podcaster, John Siracusa, has a new app you
should try out if disk space on your Mac is starting to become scarce.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that anyone, anywhere, including Cupertino, truly
understands the relationship between the disk space you actually have on
your Mac and what the system reports. Cloud storage totals show what&#39;s
in the cloud, not on your hard drive. Then there is the whole purgeable
space concept. Another factor that contributes to the mystery and one
that I just learned about is what happens on AFPS formatted drives when
you duplicate a file. I&#39;ll let the legendary Mac developer, John
Siracusa, explain:</p>

<blockquote>Today, most Mac users don’t even notice that using the “Duplicate” command in the Finder to make a copy of a file doesn’t actually copy the file’s contents. Instead, it makes a “clone” file that shares its data with the original file. That’s why duplicating a file in the Finder is nearly instant, no matter how large the file is. Despite knowing about clone files since the APFS introduction nearly eight years ago, I didn’t give them much thought beyond the tiny thrill of knowing that I wasn’t eating any more disk space when I duplicated a large file in the Finder. But late last year, as my Mac’s disk slowly filled, I started to muse about how I might be able to get some disk space back. If I could find files that had the same content but were <em>not</em> clones of each other, I could convert them into clones that all shared a single instance of the data on disk. I took an afternoon to whip up a ...scrip... to see how much space I might be able to save by doing this. It turned out to be a lot: dozens of gigabytes.</blockquote>

<p>There are plenty of Mac apps that will save disk space by finding
duplicate files and then <em>deleting</em> the duplicates. Using APFS
clones, this app can reclaim disk space without removing any files.</p>

<p>If you have technical questions, there is extensive documentation on
Siracusa&#39;s blog - <a
href="https://hypercritical.co/hyperspace/">Hyperspace</a></p>

<p>Siracusa went on to convert the script he wrote into a native Mac app,
written in Swift. You can get it <a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperspace-reclaim-disk-space/id6739505345?mt=12">from
the App Store</a> for free and run it against your Mac&#39;s file system to
see how much disk space you can reclaim. If it&#39;s a significant amount,
you have several subscription and purchase options:</p>

<ul>
<li>$9.99 a month</li>
<li>$19.99 a year</li>
<li>$49.99 lifetime</li>
</ul>
