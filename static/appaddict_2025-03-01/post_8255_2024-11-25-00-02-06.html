<p><br />I looked at the <a
href="https://www.macupdater.net/app_updates/top-25-mac-apps.html">list
of the top 25 most downloaded apps</a> as compiled by MacUpdater, who I
figure are as good a source as any and drew a few conclusions.</p>

<ol>
<li>VLC</li>
<li>Pages</li>
<li>AppCleaner</li>
<li>Numbers</li>
<li>Keynote</li>
<li>iMovie</li>
<li>The Unarchiver</li>
<li>GarageBand</li>
<li>Android File Transfer</li>
<li>Speedtest</li>
<li>Amphetamine</li>
<li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</li>
<li>Microsoft Teams</li>
<li>Transmission</li>
<li>HandBrake</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
<li>Microsoft Word</li>
<li>Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>ImageOptim</li>
<li>OneDrive</li>
<li>Bartender</li>
<li>Magnet</li>
<li>IINA</li>
</ol>

<p>Only five of the apps in the list are paid apps. They are  the big three
in Microsoft Office, the menu bar manager, Bartender and the window
manager, Magnet.</p>

<p>The vendor with the most apps on the list is surprisingly, Microsoft
with five.</p>

<p>For it&#39; market share to be as small as it, Firefox must have a higher
proportion of Mac users employing it than PC users.</p>

<p>I would wager that VLC&#39;s popularity is due to its longevity and because
of enterprise deployments. I know I have been putting it on images in
the educational space for as long as I can remember. IINA seems more
popular with more knowledgeable users,</p>

<p>Despite all the predictions made about Bartender&#39;s future after the
botched handling of its sale, it is the most downloaded paid app in the
ecosystem after Microsoft Office.</p>

<p>I have never been a big user of window management tools, and I had no
idea Magnet was as popular as it is. It has 165,000 reviews in the App
Store and a 4.9 rating.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that the top 25 apps did not include a single
notes app, automation tool or clipboard manager. The only messaging app
is Microsoft Teams, and I hesitate to say that is its primary function.</p>

<p>The presence of the six-year-old Android File Transfer app is
mind-blowing. I suspect this indicates that the download figures are
worldwide and include countries where Androids have huge market share.</p>

<p>The high ranking of App Cleaner is good for two reasons - it
demonstrates that an app doesn&#39;t have to be updated constantly to be
useful (last update was 2023-07-05). It also shows that lots of people
believe in doing more than just dragging unwanted apps to the trash.</p>
