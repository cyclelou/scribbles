<p>Preventing your Mac from going to sleep is as easy as opening a terminal
window and entering the <strong><em>caffeinate</em></strong> command. If
you do that, your Mac will stay awake until you type the
<strong><em>uncaffeinate</em></strong> command. Easy right? If you want
more control, however, I suggest getting the free Mac utility by William
Gustafson, Amphetamine for its granular settings. In its most simple
iteration Amphetamine keeps your Mac awake until you turn it off, until
a file finishes downloading or for a given duration. You can build
complex triggers in the settings using criteria like whether a certain
drive is plugged in or what the battery level is. There are some
interesting extras, like keeping spinning hard drives awake or
simulating mouse movements. If you are disturbed by the menu bar icon
resembling a pill, there are several to choose from including the
classic coffee cup used by the deprecated app Caffeine from Amphetamine
is descended.</p>

<p>My personal favorite use case is one I use every two weeks when my house
cleaning service comes in. That&#39;s the only day I close my MacBook. I use
the setting to keep my Mac awake while closed until 5:30 PM. That way if
I need to remote into it during the day, it&#39;s available without me
having to leave it out in the way of the housecleaner.</p>
