<p>I had a real-world task today that was perfect for AI, except all the
tools I tried kept quitting halfway through. I had a list of over 100
URLs that I needed to convert into a Chrome bookmark file for an import
I was trying to do. This involves going out on the internet to get the
title of each page and formatting an HTML link, complete with the
correct header and footer.</p>

<p>I tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google Gemini Pro</li>
<li>ChatGPT Web Interface</li>
<li><a href="https://www.typingmind.com/">Typing Mind</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All three of these would generate between 40–50 lines of code and then
quit. The last app I tried was <a
href="https://elephas.app/">Elephas</a>. I used a very simple prompt,
&quot;You are a web developer. You create web pages based on descriptions
given to you.&quot; The reason Elephas succeeded where others failed was
because of the choices it offers in AI models and the limits on them. It
allows you to choose between:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenAI (15 different choices)</li>
<li>Groq</li>
<li>Claude (7 different choices)</li>
<li>Custom (local)</li>
<li>Gemini (four different choices)</li>
</ul>

<p>I selected gpt-4-turbo and was able to set the context tokens to a max
of 100,000. It took a while to generate the file, but it finally did it
in a usable format.</p>

<p>Elephas has a variety of pricing plans for both subscriptions, starting
at 8.99amonthforlimitedusageupto249 for a lifetime plan with unlimited
tokens. I use the version that is available through Setapp with my own
API keys for OpenAI and Gemini, for which the charges are negligible.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature of Elephas is its ability to scan folders of
documents on your local machine and incorporate that knowledge into its
answers. I have an <a
href="https://louplummer.lol/.obsidian.amerpie.lol">Obsidian</a> vault
with 7K notes that it uses, as well as a 1GB directory of PDF files on
various topics. It can also do all the standard things we&#39;ve come to
expect from AI apps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generate ideas</li>
<li>Summarization</li>
<li>Write articles (don't do this, it's lazy)</li>
<li>Answer questions</li>
<li>Reply to emails</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also an iOS version of Elephas.</p>
