<p>Mac users have several choices when it comes to file finding apps
ranging from the built in Spotlight utility up to professional grade
tools like Foxtrot, costing north of $100. The best app for you depends
on your use cases. I tend to do the same type of searches over and over,
so I need a utility that has saved searches or templates. I also often
search for a specific file, so I want a nice, clean interface that&#39;s
easy to launch and access.</p>

<p><strong>Launchers</strong> - App launching utilities like <a
href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, <a
href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a>, <a
href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a>
and <a href="https://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a> all have file finding
capabilities and various other tricks up their sleeve like the ability
to open the found files in apps other than the default.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/freeware">EasyFind</a>
(free) from Devon Technologies finds files and folders by name, content,
tags, or comments using advanced Boolean operators, wildcards, phrases,
even regular expressions. It does not require indexing, is fast, and
uses very little memory.</p>

<p><a href="https://findanyfile.app/">Find any File</a> ($6) -  FAF
can find files that Spotlight doesn&#39;t, e.g. on network (NAS) and other
external volumes, hidden ones inside bundles and packages, and those in
folders that are usually excluded from Spotlight search, such as the
System and Library folders. It can even search in other user&#39;s folders
if you use FAF&#39;s unique root search mode.</p>

<p><a href="https://naarakstudio.com/scherlokk/">Scherlokk</a> ($19) is a
file search utility build for precise and reliable search of every file
which meets the search criteria. Music, pictures, bookmarks, documents,
etc can be found quickly and easily. Search can be made on any kind of
build in volume, portable volume (thumb drives, memory cards, USB
drives), network drive (AFP, SMB, FTP). It does not use the Spotlight
Index. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.zeroonetwenty.com/profind/">ProFind</a> ($6.99) -
With support for innovative natural language queries, application
launching, saved searches, history, scripting and more. It includes an
iOS app that lets you search your Mac from your phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://foxtrot-search.com/">Foxtrot Professional Search</a>
($120) - Made for search on a NAS or file server. Features include
multiple indices, advanced search criteria. It has advanced in-document
searching. It finds hidden gems in terabytes of PDF, word processing,
email, presentations and 300+ document types and their metadata.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/?lang=en">Houdah Spot</a> -
($34, included in Setapp) A fast a very configurable utility offering
hundreds of criteria, exportable results, featuring templates for
reoccurring searches, like the one I do every Sunday for Markdown files
created in the last seven days to import into Eagle Filer. This is my
personal Go To.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.houdah.com/tembo/?lang=en">Tembo</a> ($15) - Made
by Houdah Software, this utility is very fast and rarely lets me down.
It&#39;s what i use when I&#39;m searching for one particular file.  The real
power of Tembo is revealed when you drill down into a group. Filters
appropriate to the current group help you quickly find what you are
looking for.</p>
