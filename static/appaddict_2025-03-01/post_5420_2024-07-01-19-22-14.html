<p>Trickster is one of those apps you have to use consistently in order to
appreciate what it can do. It takes some thought to set it up and you
may even need to refine that after some use. But, once you get it dialed
in and are used to using it, you&#39;ll wonder how you ever got along
without it. Trickster is for people who work with files, whether they be
photos, or word-processing documents, spreadsheets, screenshots or
whatever. If your computer usage is limited to using your browser and
gaming this is not an app you&#39;ll get much value out of, but if you do
much writing, design, development or photography, you should take
advantage of the 14-day full featured trial on the developer&#39;s website
to see if it will improve your workflow.</p>

<p>The developer describes Trickster like this - &quot;Trickster keeps track of
recent files you’ve been using on your Mac and gives you super easy and
lightning fast access to them.&quot; It&#39;s easy to summon and navigate using
the keyboard. It&#39;s a menu bar app that opens a window with access to
different file lists when summoned. You can perform many Finder
functions (delete, rename etc.) right in the Trickster interface. It
supports drag and drop functions too. Trickster makes it easy to find
files, especially if you make use of its advanced filtering options. You
can include or exclude any file type or folder in your search criteria.
You can set up favorite locations if your don&#39;t match the preconfigured
favorites. It works fine with multiple cloud services even if you have
more than one account per service (e.g., work and personal One Drive
accounts).</p>

<p>Trickster is $29.99 on <a
href="https://www.apparentsoft.com/trickster">the developer&#39;s
website</a> where you get a two-week free trial or you can get it from
<a
href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trickster-recently-used-files/id509641724?mt=12">the
Mac App Store</a> for the same price. It&#39;s also available as part of
Setapp, the Mac app subscription service with over 240 apps for $9.99 a
month. It was last updated one month ago, and its privacy policy states
that it collects no data on users at all.</p>
